Friday 17 October	It is disgraceful. I did run up stairs thinking I'd make time to enter that astounding fact—the last words of the last page of Mrs Dalloway; but was interrupted. Anyhow I did them a week ago yesterday. "For there she was." & I felt glad to be quit of it, for it has been a strain the last weeks, yet fresher in the head; with less I mean of the usual feeling that I've shaved through, & just kept my feet on the tight rope. I feel indeed rather more fully relieved of my meaning than usual—whether this will stand when I re-read is doubtful. But in some ways this book is a feat; finished without break from illness, wh. is an exception; & written really, in one year; & finally, written from the end of March to the 8th of October without more than a few days break for writing journalism. So it may differ from the others. Anyhow, I feel that I have exorcised the spell wh. Murry & others said I had laid myself under after Jacob's Room. The only difficulty is to hold myself back from writing others. My cul-de- sac, as they called it, stretches so far, & shows such vistas. I see already The Old Man.	But enough, enough—yet of what should I write here except my writing? Odd how conventional morality always encroaches. One must not talk of oneself &c; one must not be vain &c. Even in complete privacy these ghosts slip between me & the page. But I must here break off to go to the post, down that wonderful lamplit street, which has become more lovely more unreal through my double windows. And I sit shielded within. This house is now perfect. The studio the best study I've ever had.	The thought of Katherine Mansfield comes to me—as usual rather reprehensibly—first wishing she could see Southampton Row, thinking of the dulness of her death, lying there at Fontainebleau—an end where there was no end, & then thinking yes, if she'd lived, she'd have written on, & people would have seen that I was the more gifted—that wd. only have become more & more apparent. Indeed, so I suppose it would. I think of her in this way off & on—that strange ghost, with the eyes far apart, & the drawn mouth, dragging herself across her room. And Murry married again to a woman who spends an hour in the W.C. & so the Anreps have turned them out. Murry whines publicly for a flat in the Adelphi. Thats a sordid page of my life by the way, Murry. But I stick to it; K. & I had our relationship; & never again shall I have one like it.	Lytton dined here the other night—a successful evening. Oh I was right to be in love with him 12 or 15 years ago. It is an exquisite symphony his nature when all the violins get playing as they did the other night; so deep, so fantastic. We rambled easily. He is in love again with Philip Ritchie. And hurt, a little; still capable of pain; but knows it now ridiculous, which hurts him too. & he feels it. For when I asked if we could help he was touched. We talked of his writing, & I think now he will write another book; of mine; of the School of Proust, he said; then of Maynard; one side of him detestable; should have married Barbara; grown fat; of Nessa's picture, which he may buy (I want to see Nessa at this moment, & she's gone to Norfolk to look at a house, & I hope she won't take it, & leave London & Charleston & live till she dies, with her children painting in Norfolk & I here, & L. may go to India—thats been brooding over me since I came back & he told me at tea the first afternoon, Saturday, how he'd been asked to go by the ILP & wanted very much to go, & take a week off to see Hambantota which a little hurt me. But I said to myself this is a side of life I've not lain on. I must face that too. Still nothing has been heard, though I still a little dread the mornings post, but this is concealed from L.—if he went, it would be after the Election, in Nov. Yes, after the Election, for owing to the defeat of the Govt. in the Campbell Case, we are now condemned to a dose of lies every morning: the usual yearly schoolboys wrangle has begun. If I were still a feminist, I should make capital out of the wrangle. But I have travelled on—as K.M. said to me, she saw me as a ship far out at sea. But K.M. always said affectionate admiring things to me, poor woman, whom in my own way I suppose I loved. Human affections are not to be called by very strong, or rather very positive names, I think. Heres poor old Jacques writing to me, & Gwen wants to come & see me, after 11 years: a relationship revived by the art of the pen, across France. I rather dread revivals: partly vanity; you're fatter, less beautiful; changed; so self-conscious [?] am I; & then—the effort. Seeing people, now I see them so easily, is an effort. Why ——	Phil Baker is standing as a Labour candidate. Irene will have his teeth filed & get him in—(a scrap of real dialogue). Did I put down my progress towards Perpetual Immortality (to quote one of Peggy Webling's wishes as a child—a Brief I'm doing, or should be doing?) I asked Todd £10 for 1,000 words: she orders 4 articles at that fee: Harper wishes me (I think) to write an American Browns & Bennetts; & Vogue, (via Dadie) is going to take up Mrs Woolf, to boom her: &—&—&— So very likely this time next year I shall be one of those people who are, so father said, in the little circle of London Society which represents the Apostles, I think, on a larger scale. Or does this no longer exist? To know everyone worth knowing. I can just see what he meant; just imagine being in that position—if women can be. Lytton is: Maynard; Ld Balfour; not perhaps Hardy. Which reminds me I ought to dash in Mrs Hardy in a nursing home, having had her tumour cut out; with Miss Charlotte Mew. Nothing very exciting, even as a boast not very exciting now. H. remembers your father: did not like many people, but was fond of him; talks of him often. Would like to know you. But I cant easily fit into that relation; the daughter grateful for old compliments to her father. Yet I should like to see him; to hear him—say something. But what? One or two words about a flower, or a view, or a garden chair, perhaps.	(It strikes me that in this book I practise writing; do my scales; yes & work at certain effects. I daresay I practised Jacob here,—& Mrs D. & shall invent my next book here; for here I write merely in the spirit— great fun it is too, & old V. of 1940 will see something in it too. She will be a woman who can see, old V.: everything—more than I can I think. But I'm tired now.)
Monday 8 February	Just back from Rodmell—to use again the stock opening. And I should explain why I've let a month slip perhaps. First, I think, the German measles or influenza; next Vita; then, disinclination for any exertion, so that I never made a book till last week. But undoubtedly this diary is established, & I sometimes look at it & wonder what on earth will be the fate of it. It is to serve the purpose of my memoirs. At 60 I am to sit down & write my life. As rough material for that masterpiece—& knowing the caprice of my own brain as record reader for I never know what will take my fancy, I here record that I come in to find the following letters waiting me. 1. Ottoline, on that wonderful essay On Being Ill. She is doing a cure. 2. A long letter of hysterical flattery from Miss Keiller [Kieffer] who is translating Jacob's Room. 3. a card, showing me her character in an unfavourable light from Miss Ethel Pye, who once met me in an omnibus & wishes to take a mask of my head; 4. a letter from Harcourt Brace enclosing cheque from the Forum for O[n]. B[eing]. Ill. 5. a letter asking me to become one of the Committee of the English Association; 6. a cutting on Hogarth Essays from the Dial; 7. a note from Clive asking me to dine to meet his brother. I think this makes me out rather specially important. It is 3 days post. I am rather tired, a little tired, from having thought too much about To the Lighthouse. Never never have I written so easily, imagined so profusely. Murry says my works won't be read in 10 years time—Well, tonight I get a new edition of the V[oyage]. O[ut]. from Harcourt Brace—this was published 11 years ago.
Tuesday 23 February	Here is the usual door bell/ & I think Gwen came in, & I was rather sodden & wretched, feeling that I had nothing to give her, & she everything to ask. As I foretold, she is enmeshed in a net of fire: that is the truth; loves net; the fiery net of—who was it?—that was scorched to death: & hers is more painful than his, & more enduring. Yet how seldom one envisages what one knows! Her net lies on me; but it does not burn me. And I do little futile kindnesses to her, which are little good to anybody; & I don't do them, & I feel compunction. Of all this I have little appetite to write, being exacerbated 1. because Nelly won't make marmalade; 2. because a certain function impends; 3. because I can't go, in deference to L.'s wish, to Mortimer's farewell party, 4. because Dadie asked me to tea, & I did not go; 5. because—the last because I cannot now remember—a vague dissatisfaction: spring & funerals; yellow lights & white blossoms; beautiful black yellow pointed squares—& so on. Vita is a dumb letter writer, & I miss her. I miss the glow & the flattery & the festival. I miss her, I suppose, not very intimately. Nevertheless, I do miss her, & wish it were May 10th; & then I don't wish it; for I have such a razor edge to my palette that seeing people often disgusts me of seeing them.	I am blown like an old flag by my novel. This one is To the Lighthouse. I think it is worth saying for my own interest that at last at last, after that battle Jacob's Room, that agony—all agony but the end, Mrs Dalloway, I am now writing as fast & freely as I have written in the whole of my life; more so—20 times more so—than any novel yet. I think this is the proof that I was on the right path; & that what fruit hangs in my soul is to be reached there. Amusingly, I now invent theories that fertility & fluency are the things: I used to plead for a kind of close, terse, effort. Anyhow this goes on all the morning; & I have the devils own work not to be flogging my brain all the afternoon. I live entirely in it, & come to the surface rather obscurely & am often unable to think what to say when we walk round the Square, which is bad I know. Perhaps it may be a good sign for the book though. Of course it is largely known to me: but all my books have been that. It is, I feel, that I can float everything off now; & "everything" is rather a crowd & weight & confusion in the mind.	Then I have seen Lytton: seen Eddy; Mary; I forget: I have been discreet in my society, & enjoyed it. Perhaps I am again brisking, after my lethargy. The publishing season is about to begin. Nessa says Why don't you give it up? I say, because I enjoy it. Then I wonder, but do I? What about Rome & Sicily? And Manning Sanders is not worth the grind. Am I a fanatical enthusiast for work, like my father? I think I have a strain of that, but I don't relish it. Tonight Francis Birrell & Rose Macaulay dine with us. To celebrate the occasion, I have bought a toast rack & a bedspread, which covers that atrocious chest of drawers wh. has worried me these 2 years. I am now so pleased with the colour that I go out & look at it.
Saturday 27 March	To continue—I don't know why I should really tell the story of the Nation—it doesn't figure largely in our lives. But Leonard met Phil Baker, who says he will get £300 as lecturer at the School of Economics easily if he wants it. He came in that night & said this & then we went off on a blowing night to dine at Rose M.'s 'pothouse', as I so mistakenly called it. There were 10 second rate writers in second rate dress clothes, Lynds, Goulds, O'Donovan: no, I won't in any spasm of hypocritical humanity include Wolves. L. by the way was in his red brown tweed. Then the pitter patter began; the old yard was scratched over by these baldnecked chickens. The truth was that we had no interests private; literature was our common ground; & though I will talk literature with Desmond or Lytton by the hour, when it comes to pecking up grains with these active stringy fowls my gorge rises. What d'you think of the Hawthornden prize? Why isn't Masefield as good as Chaucer, or Gerhardi as good as Tchekov: how can I embark with Gerald Gould on such topics? He reads novels incessantly; got a holiday 3 years ago, & prided himself on reading nothing but Tchekhov; knows all about a novel in the first chapter. Sylvias & Geralds & Roberts & Roses chimed & tinkled round the table. A stout woman called Gould got steadily more & more mustard & tomato coloured. I said Holy Ghost? when Mr O'Donovan said the whole of the coast. Lodged on a low sofa in Rose's underground cheerful, sane, breezy room I talked to a young cultivated man, who turned out to be Hinks, Roger, British Museum, mild aesthete, variety of Leigh Ashton; but thank God, not a second rate journalist. All the time I kept saying to myself Thank God to be out of that; out of the Nation; no longer brother in arms with Rose & Robert & Sylvia. It is a thinblooded set; so 'nice', 'kind', respectable, cleverish & in the swim.	Then our set at Nessa's last night, was hardly at its best. L. & Adrian silent & satirical; old Sickert rather toothless & set; I driven to chatter, not well; but Nessa & Duncan don't consolidate & order these parties; so home in a spasm of outraged vanity, & not that altogether, for I had worked honestly if feebly, & L. had not; & then he was off early this morning to Rodmell where Philcox is in the thick of building & drains: so I had no time to uncrease my rose leaf; had to try & work, to finish the rather long drawn out dinner scene [in To the Lighthouse], & was just striking oil when in comes Angus to tell me Eddy was on the phone: would I go to Rimsky Korsakov with him on Tuesday. I agreed—more, asked him to dinner. Then was all a whirl & flutter of doubts; detested the engagement; could not settle; suddenly shook my coat, like a retriever; faced facts; sent Eddy a wire, & a letter "Cant come—detest engagements", & pondered where shall I spend the day? decided on Greenwich, arrived there at 1; lunched; everything fell out pat; smoked a cigarette on the pier promenade, saw the ships swinging up, one two, three, out of the haze; adored it all; yes even the lavatory keepers little dog; saw the grey Wren buildings fronting the river; & then another great ship, grey & orange; with a woman walking on deck; & then to the hospital; first to the Museum where I saw Sir John Franklin's pen & spoons (a spoon asks a good deal of imagination to consecrate it)—I played with my mind watching what it would do,—& behold if I didn't almost burst into tears over the coat Nelson wore at Trafalgar with the medals which he hid with his hand when they carried him down, dying, lest the sailors might see it was him. There was too, his little fuzzy pigtail, of golden greyish hair tied in black; & his long white stockings, one much stained, & his white breeches with the gold buckles, & his stock—all of which I suppose they must have undone & taken off as he lay dying. Kiss me Hardy &c—Anchor, anchor,—I read it all when I came in, & could swear I was there on the Victory—So the charm worked in that case. Then it was raining a little, but I went into the Park, which is all prominence & radiating paths; then back on top of a bus, & so to tea. Molly [McCarthy] came, a warm faithful bear, of whom I am really fond, judging from the steady accumulation of my desire to see her these last 3 or 4 weeks, culminating in my asking her to come, as I so rarely ask anyone to come. Saxon came, with his great grandfather's diary, which it pleases him I should like, & call like him; & then reading & bed. I think my rose leaf is now uncrumpled. Certainly I shall remember the ships coming up (here Tomlin rings, but I won't see him—solitude is my bride, & she is adulterated by Clive & Mary tonight) & Nelson's coat long after I have forgotten how silly & uncomfortable I was at Nessa's on Friday.
Sunday 18 April	<This is written>	This is not written very seriously.—obviously not—to try a pen, I think. And it is now [Friday] April 30th, the last of a wet windy month, excepting the sudden opening of all the doors at Easter, & the summer displayed blazing, as it always is, I suppose; only cloud hidden. I have not said anything about Iwerne Minster. Now it would amuse me to see what I remember it by. Cranbourne Chase: the stunted aboriginal forest trees, scattered, not grouped in cultivations; anemones, bluebells, violets, all pale, sprinkled about, without colour, livid, for the sun hardly shone. Then Blackmore Vale; a vast air dome & the fields dropped to the bottom; the sun striking, there, there; a drench of rain falling, like a veil streaming from the sky, there & there; & the downs rising, very strongly scarped (if that is the word) so that they were ridged & ledged; then an inscription in a church "sought peace & ensured it", & the question, who wrote these sonorous stylistic epitaphs?—& all the cleanliness of Iwerne village, its happiness & well being, making me ask, as we tended to sneer. Still this is the right method, surely; & then tea & cream—these I remember: the hot baths; my new leather coat; Shaftesbury, so much lower & less commanding than my imagination, & the drive to Bournemouth, & the dog & the lady behind the rock, & the view of Swanage, & coming home.	And then it was horror: Nelly; faced her going; was firm yet desolate; on Tuesday she stopped me on the landing said "Please ma'am may I apologise?" & this time we had been so resolute & implicitly believed her that I had written 6 letters. No cooks however came; & I had enough look into the 'servant question' to be glad to be safe again with Nelly. Now I vow come what may, never never to believe her again. "I am too fond of you ever to be happy with anyone else" she said. Talking of compliments, this is perhaps the greatest I could have. But my mind is wandering. It is a question of clothes. This is what humiliates me—talking of compliments—to walk in Regent St, Bond Str &c: & be notably less well dressed than other people.	Yesterday I finished the first part of To the Lighthouse, & today began the second. I cannot make it out—here is the most difficult abstract piece of writing—I have to give an empty house, no people's characters, the passage of time, all eyeless & featureless with nothing to cling to: well, I rush at it, & at once scatter out two pages. Is it nonsense, is it brilliance? Why am I so flown with words, & apparently free to do exactly what I like? When I read a bit it seems spirited too; needs compressing, but not much else. Compare this dashing fluency with the excruciating hard wrung battles I had with Mrs Dalloway (save the end). This is not made up: it is the literal fact. Yes, & I am rather famous. For the rest, we dally about the Nation. Maynard, dressed in a light overcoat, is back; hums & haws about standing for the Provost of King's. We tell him Lydia would like it. He says it means middle age & respectability. I feel some sympathy for him. This is because he is going grey, I tell Clive. Clive's back; Nessa departing, & I worrying about my clothes, & how Roger last night upset me by saying that Nessa finds fault with my temper behind my back. Then (at Ralph's new left handed establishment) Inez, rather like Vivien [Eliot] to look at, searches into my eyes with her greenish pink-rimmed ones, & says, I must tell you two things: then she tells me that she admires me. That swallowed (doubtfully) she says, Did you ever have an affair with Oliver? The connection is this: she disliked me, from jealousy. I protest I never kissed him, & he never looked at me. She refuses to believe. So she has been refusing to believe for years—A queer little interview, stage managed by Oliver* & she: at last brought off. I called in Leonard, & I think convinced her.	* Oliver denied all knowledge of this; & said she invented it in order to have an excuse for an intimate conversation. “So many women are like that” said Rose Macaulay sitting spruce lean, like a mummified cat, in her chair (this is written Aug. 12th)

Wednesday 5 May	An exact diary of the Strike would be interesting. For instance, it is now a 1/4 to 2: there is a brown fog; nobody is building; it is drizzling. The first thing in the morning we stand at the window & watch the traffic in Southampton Row. This is incessant. Everyone is bicycling; motor cars are huddled up with extra people. There are no buses. No placards. no newspapers. The men are at work in the road; water, gas & electricity are allowed; but at 11 the light was turned off. I sat in the press in the brown fog, while L. wrote an article for the Herald. A very revolutionary looking young man on a cycle arrived with the British Gazette. L. is to answer an article in this. All was military stern a little secret. Then Clive dropped in, the door being left open. He is offering himself to the Government. Maynard excited, wants the H[ogarth]. P[ress]. to bring out a skeleton number of the Nation. It is all tedious & depressing, rather like waiting in a train outside a station. Rumours are passed round—that the gas wd. be cut off at 1—false of course. One does not know what to do. And nature has laid it on thick today—fog, rain, cold. A voice, rather commonplace & official, yet the only common voice left, wishes us good morning at 10. This is the voice of Britain, to wh. we can make no reply. The voice is very trivial, & only tells us hat the Prince of Wales is coming back (from Biarritz), that the London streets present an unprecedented spectacle.
Thursday 6 May	(one of the curious effects of the Strike is that it is difficult to remember the day of the week). Everything is the same, but unreasonably, or because of the weather, or habit, we are more cheerful, take less notice, & occasionally think of other things. The taxis are out today. There are various skeleton papers being sold. One believes nothing. Clive dines in Mayfair, & everyone is pro-men; I go to Harrison [dentist], & he shouts me down with "Its red rag versus Union Jack, Mrs Woolf" & how Thomas has 100,000. Frankie dines out, & finds everyone pro- Government. Bob [Trevelyan] drops in & says Churchill is for peace, but Baldwin wont budge. Clive says Churchill is for tear gas bombs, fight to the death, & is at the bottom of it all. So we go on, turning in our cage. I notice how frequently we break of[f] with "Well I don't know." According to L. this open state of mind is due to the lack of papers. It feels like a deadlock, on both sides; as if we could keep fixed like this for weeks. What one prays for is God: the King or God; some impartial person to say kiss & be friends—as apparently we all desire.	Just back from a walk to the Strand. Of course one notices lorries full of elderly men & girls standing like passengers in the old 3rd class carriages. Children swarm. They pick up bits of old wood paving. Everything seems to be going fast, away, in business[?]. The shops are open but empty. Over it all is some odd pale unnatural atmosphere— great activity but no normal life. I think we shall become more in- dependent & stoical as the days go on. And I am involved in dress buying with Todd [editor of Vogue]; I tremble & shiver all over at the appalling magnitude of the task have undertaken—to go to a dress- maker recommended by Todd, even, she suggested, but here my blood ran cold, with Todd. Perhaps this excites me more feverishly than the Strike. It is a little like the early hours of the morning (this state of things) when one has been up all night. Business improved today. We sold a few books. Bob cycled from Leith Hill, getting up at 5 a.m. to avoid the crowd. He punctured an hour later, met his tailor who mended him, set forth again, was almost crushed in the crowd near London, & has since been tramping London, from Chelsea to Bloomsbury to gather gossip, & talk, incoherently about Desmond's essays & his own poetry. He has secreted two more of these works which 'ought to be published'. He is ravenous greedy, & apelike, but has a kind of russet surly charm; like a dog one teases. He complained how Logan teased him. Clive calls in to discuss bulletins—indeed, more than anything it is like a house where someone is dangerously ill; & friends drop in to enquire, & one has to wait for doctor's news—Quennel, the poet, came; a lean boy, nervous, plaintive, rather pretty; on the look out for work, & come to tap the Wolves—who are said, I suppose to be an authority on that subject. We suggested Desmond's job. After an hour of this, he left, — here Clive came in & interrupted. He has been shopping in the West End with Mary. Nothing to report there. He & L. listened in at 7 & heard nothing. The look of the streets—how people "trek to work" that is the stock phrase: that it will be cold & windy tomorrow (it is shivering cold today) that there was a warm debate in the Commons—	Among the crowd of trampers in Kingsway were old Pritchard, toothless, old wispy, benevolent; who tapped L. on the shoulder & said he was "training to shoot him"; & old Miss Pritchard, equally frail, dusty, rosy, shabby. "How long will it last Mrs Woolf?" "Four weeks" "Ah dear!" Off they tramp, over the bridge to Kennington I think; next in Kingsway comes the old battered clerk, who has 5 miles to walk. Miss Talbot has an hours walk; Mrs Brown 2 hours walk. But they all arrive, & clatter about as usual—Pritchard doing poor peoples work for nothing, as I imagine his way is, & calling himself a Tory.	Then we are fighting the Square on the question of leading dogs. Dogs must be led; but tennis can be played they say. L. is advancing to the fight, & has enlisted the Pekinese in the Square. We get no news from abroad; neither can send it. No parcels. Pence have been added to milk, vegetables &c. And Karin has bought 4 joints.	It is now a chilly lightish evening; very quiet; the only sound a distant barrel organ playing. The bricks stand piled on the building & there remain. And Viola was about to make our fortune. She dined here, Monday night, the night of the strike.
Friday 7 May	No change. "London calling the British Isles. Good morning every- one". That is how it begins at 10. The only news that the archbishops are conferring, & ask our prayers that they may be guided right. Whether this means action, we know not. We know nothing. Mrs Cartwright walked from Hampstead. She & L. got heated arguing, she being anti- labour; because she does not see why they should be supported, & observes men in the street loafing instead of working. Very little work done by either of us today. A cold, wet day, with sunny moments. All arrangements unchanged. Girl came to make chair covers, having walked from Shoreditch, but enjoyed it. Times sent for 25 Violas. Question whether to bring out a skeleton Roneo Nation. Leonard went to the office, I to the Brit[ish] Mus[eum]; where all was chill serenity, dignity & severity. Written up are the names of great men; & we all cower like mice nibbling crumbs in our most official discreet impersonal mood beneath. I like this dusty bookish atmosphere. Most of the readers seemed to have rubbed their noses off & written their eyes out. Yet they have a life they like—believe in the necessity of making books, I suppose: verify, collate, make up other books, for ever. It must be 15 years since I read here. I came home & found L. & Hubert [Henderson] arriving from the office—Hubert did what is now called "taking a cup of tea", which means an hour & a halfs talk about the Strike. Here is his prediction: if it is not settled, or in process, on Monday, it will last 5 weeks. Today no wages are paid. Leonard said he minded this more than the war & Hubert told us how he had travelled in Germany, & what brutes they were in 1912. He thinks gas & electricity will go next; had been at a journal- ists meeting where all were against labour (against the general strike that is) & assumed Government victory. L. says if the state wins & smashes T[rades]. U[nion]s he will devote his life to labour: if the archbishop succeeds, he will be baptised. Now to dine at the Commercio to meet Clive.
Sunday 9 May	There is no news of the strike. The broadcaster has just said that we are praying today. And L. & I quarrelled last night. I dislike the tub thumper in him; he the irrational Xtian in me. I will write it all out later— my feelings about the Strike; but I am now writing to test my theory that there is consolation in expression. Unthinkingly, I refused just now to lunch with the Phil Bakers, who fetched L. in their car. Suddenly, 10 minutes ago, I began to regret this profoundly. How I should love the talk, & seeing the house, & battling my wits against theirs. Now the sensible thing to do is to provide some pleasure to balance this, which I cd. not have had, if I had gone. I can only think of writing this, & going round the Square. Obscurely, I have my clothes complex to deal with. When I am asked out my first thought is, but I have no clothes to go in. Todd has never sent me the address of the shop; & I may have annoyed her by refusing to lunch with her. But the Virginia who refuses is a very instinctive & therefore powerful person. The reflective & sociable only comes to the surface later. Then the conflict. Baldwin broadcast last night: he rolls his rs; tries to put more than mortal strength into his words. "Have faith in me. You elected me 18 months ago. What have I done to forfeit your confidence? Can you not trust me to see justice done between man & man?" Impressive as it is to hear the very voice of the Prime Minister, descendant of Pitt & Chatham, still I can't heat up my reverence to the right pitch. I picture the stalwart oppressed man, bearing the world on his shoulders. And suddenly his self assertiveness becomes a little ridiculous. He becomes megalomaniac. No I dont trust him: I don't trust any human being, however loud they bellow & roll their rs.
Monday 10 May	Quarrel with L. settled in studio. Oh, but how incessant the arguments & interruptions are! As I write, L. is telephoning to Hubert. We are getting up a petition. There was a distinct thaw (we thought) last night. The Arch B. & Grey both conciliatory. So we went to bed happy. Today ostensibly the same dead lock; beneath the surface all sorts of currents, of which we get the most contradictory reports. Dear old Frankie has a story (over the fire in the bookshop) of an interview between Asquith & Reading which turned Reading hostile to the men. Later, through Clive, through Desmond, Asquith is proved to be at the Wharfe, 60 miles from Lord Reading. Lady Wimbore gave a party— brought Thomas & Baldwin together. Meeting mysteriously called off today. Otherwise strike wd. have been settled. I to H of Commons this morning with L.'s article to serve as stuffing for Hugh Dalton in the Commons this afternoon. All this humbug of police & marble statues vaguely displeasing. But the Gvt. provided me with buses both ways, & no stones thrown. Silver & crimson guard at Whitehall; the cenotaph, & men bare heading themselves. Home to find Tom Marshall caballing with L.; after lunch to [Birrell & Garnett's] bookshop, where the gossip (too secret for the telephone) was imparted; to London Library where Gooch—a tall, pale mule, affable & long winded, was seen, & Molly dustily diligently reading the Dublin Review for 1840, walk home; Clive, to refute gossip; James to get St Loe to sign; then Maynard ringing up to command us to print the Nation as the N. Statesman is printed; to wh. I agreed, & L. disagreed; then dinner; a motor car collision—more telephones ringing at the moment 9.5.
Tuesday 6 January	The disgraceful truth is that I shall run year into year, for I cant waste so many blank pages.	What a flourish I began 1924 with! And today, for the 165th time, Nelly has given notice— Won't be dictated to: must do as other girls do. This is the fruit of Bloomsbury. On the whole, I'm inclined to take her at her word. The nuisance of arranging life to suit her fads, & the pressure of 'other girls' is too much, good cook though she is, & honest, crusty old maid too, dependable, in the main, affectionate, kindly, but incurably fussy, nervy, unsubstantial. Anyhow, the servant question no longer much worries me.	Last night we dined at 3 Albert Road Mary's new villa. I like the new year to begin with warm friendly feelings—& it was a superb dinner. There were the children too, a nice girl & boy; a girl with lovely womans eyes, sympathetic, startled; & wild like a girl. (I want to begin to describe my own sex.) What do I mean about the expression? Extreme youth, & yet, one felt, this feeling has been existing forever; very feminine. Here I conceive my story—but I'm always conceiving stories now. Short ones—scenes—for instance The Old Man (a character of L.S.) The Professor on Milton—(an attempt at literary criticism) & now The Interruption, women talking alone. However, back to life. Where are we?	I spent this morning writing a note on an E[lizabe]than play—for which I have been reading plays all this year. Then I found the minute hand of my watch had come off (this was talking to Lytton about [Samuel] Richardson last night—I found it off then): so I went into the printing room to see the time—found Angus & Leonard doing Simkin's bill. Stayed & laughed. L. went off to the office, when we had dog-walked round the Square. I came in & set a page of Nancy. Then out to Ingersoll to get my watch mended. Then dog walked. Then here. It being a black grained winter day; lengths of the pavement ink black where not lighted. Never shall I describe all the days I have noticed. I cannot hit it off, quite, & yet perhaps if I read this again I shall see what I meant then.	Rodmell was all gale & flood; these words are exact. The river overflowed. We had 7 days rain out of 10. Often I could not face a walk. L. pruned, which needed heroic courage. My heroism was purely literary. I revised Mrs D[alloway]: the dullest part of the whole business of writing; the most depressing & exacting. The worst part is at the beginning (as usual) where the aeroplane has it all to itself for some pages, & it wears thin. L. read it; thinks it my best—but then has he not got to think so? Still I agree. He thinks it has more continuity than J[acob]s R[oom]. but is difficult owing to the lack of connection, visible, between the two themes.	Anyhow it is sent off to Clarks, & proofs will come next week. This is for Harcourt Brace, who has accepted without seeing & raised me to 15 p.c.	I did not see very much at Rodmell, having to keep my eyes on the typewriter.	Angus was with us for Christmas, a very quiet, very considerate, unselfish deliberate young man, with a charming sense of humour—colourless, Lytton says: passive. But I think well of him, all the same.
Tuesday 11 May	I may as well continue to write—this book is used to scandalous mistreatment—while I wait—here interruptions began which lasted till the present moment/ when I write from 12.30 to 3 with Gerald Brenan in the study composing with infinite difficulty a letter to Mr Galsworthy. Arguing about the Ar[chbisho]p of Canterbury with Jack Squire at 12 seems now normal, but not—how often do I repeat—nearly as exciting as writing To the Lighthouse or about de Q[uincey]. I believe it is false psychology to think that in after years these details will be interesting. The war is now barren sand after all. But one never knows: & waiting about, writing serves to liberate the mind from the fret & itch of these innumerable details. Squire doesn't want to "knuckle under". To kneel is the duty of the Church. The Church has no connection with the nation. Events are that the Roneo workers refuse to set up L.'s article in the Nation, in which he says that the Strike is not illegal or unconstitutional. Presumably this is a little clutch of the Government throttle. Mr Baldwin has been visiting the Zoo. In the middle of lunch admirable Miss Bulley arrives, having visited Conway unsuccessfully. St Loe has joined. So Rose Macaulay & Lytton. Tonight the names are to be handed in; & then perhaps silence will descend upon us. Ralph & Gerald are our emissaries. But then everyone rings up—the most unlikely people—[Donald] Brace for instance, Kahan; the woman comes with the new sofa cover. Yester- day Ralph & Frances Marshall were in a railway accident. She had her teeth jangled. One man was killed; another had his leg broken—the result of driving a train without signals, by the efforts of ardent optimistic undergraduates. Billing has been in to say he will print anything, all his men being back & needing work. So, as poor MacDermott has been dead since January, perhaps the Nation will be done by them. Come to think of it, almost all our type is standing, so our printing was in any case hardly feasible. Must I now ring up James? Day's Library boy was set upon by roughs, had his cycle overturned, but kept his books & was unhurt after calling here for 6 Tree. Tree dribbles along. There is an occasional order. Mrs C[artwright]. arrives on Faith's bicycle which is red with rust.
Wednesday 12 May	Strike settled. (ring at bell) The Strike was settled about 1.15—or it was then broadcast. I was in Tottenham Court Rd. at 1 & heard Bartholomew & Fletcher's megaphone declaim that the T.U.C. leaders were at Downing Street; came home to find that neither L. or Nelly had heard this: 5 minutes later, the wireless. They told us to stand by & await important news. Then a piano played a tune. Then the solemn broadcaster assuming incredible pomp & gloom & speaking one word to the minute read out: Message from 10 Downing Street. The T.U.C. leaders have agreed that Strike shall be withdrawn. Instantly L. dashed off to telephone to the office, Nelly to tell Pritchard's clerk, & I to Mrs C. (But N[elly]. was beforehand) then we finished lunch; then I rang up Clive—who proposes that we should have a drink tonight. I saw this morning 5 or 6 armoured cars slowly going along Oxford Street; on each two soldiers sat in tin helmets, & one stood with his hand at the gun which was pointed straight ahead ready to fire. But I also noticed on one a policeman smoking a cigarette. Such sights I dare say I shall never see again; & dont in the least wish to. Already (it is now 10 past 2) men have appeared at the hotel with drainpipes. Also Grizzle has won her case against the Square.
Tursday 13 May	I suppose all pages devoted to the Strike will be skipped, when I read over this book. Oh that dull old chapter, I shall say. Excitements about what are called real things are always unutterably transitory. Yet it is gloomy—& L. is gloomy, & so am I unintelligibly—today because the Strike continues—no railwaymen back: vindictiveness has now seized our masters. Government shillyshallies. Apparently, the T.U.C. agreed to terms wh. the miners now reject. Anyhow it will take a week to get the machinery of England to run again. Trains are dotted about all over England. Labour, it seems clear, will be effectively diddled again, & perhaps rid of its power to make strikes in future. Printers still out at the Nation. In short, the strain removed, we all fall out & bicker & backbite. Such is human nature—& really I dont like human nature unless all candied over with art. We dined with a strike party last night & went back to Clive's. A good deal was said about art there. Good dull Janet Vaughan, reminding me of Emma, joined us. I went to my dressmaker, Miss Brooke, & found it the most quiet & friendly & even enjoyable of proceedings. I have a great lust for lovely stuffs, & shapes; wh. I have not gratified since Sally Young died. A bold move this, but now I'm free of the fret of clothes, which is worth paying for, & need not parade Oxford Street.
Thursday 20 May	Waiting for L. to come back from chess with Roger: 11.25. I think nothing need be said of the Strike. As tends to happen, one's mind slips after the crisis, & what the settlement is, or will be, I know not. We must now fan the books up again. Viola & Phil Baker were both struck on the wing. Viola comes, very tactfully, as a friend, she says, to consult after dinner. She is a flamboyant creature—much of an actress— much abused by the Waleys & Marjories; but rather taking to me. She has the great egotism, the magnification of self, which any bodily display, I think, produces. She values women by their hips & ankles, like horses. Easily reverts to the topic of her own charms: how she shd. have married the D. of Rutland. "Lord — (his uncle) told me I was the woman John really loved. The duchess said to me 'Do make love to John & get him away from —. At any rate you're tall & beautiful—' And I sometimes think if I'd married him—but he never asked me—Daddy wouldn't have died. I'd have prevented that operation: Then how he'd have loved a duke for a son in law! All his life was dressing up—that sort of thing you know." So she runs on, in the best of clothes, easy & familiar, but reserved too; with the wiles & warinesses of a woman of the world, half sordid half splendid, not quite at her ease with us, yet glad of a room where she can tell her stories, of listeners to whom she is new & strange. She will run on by the hour—yet is very watchful not to bore; a good business woman, & floating over considerable acuteness on her charm. All this however, is not making her book move, as they say. Eddy came in to tea. I like him—his flattery? his nobility? I dont know—I find him easy & eager. And Vita comes to lunch tomorrow which will be a great amusement & pleasure. I am amused at my relations with her: left so ardent in January—& now what? Also I like her presence & her beauty. Am I in love with her? But what is love? Her being 'in love' (it must be comma'd thus) with me, excites & flatters; & interests. What is this 'love'? Oh & then she gratifies my eternal curiosity: who's she seen, whats she done—for I have no enormous opinion of her poetry. How could I—I who have such delight in mitigating the works even of my greatest friends. I should have been reading her poem tonight: instead finished Sharon Turner—a prosy, simple, old man; the very spit & image of Saxon. a boundless bore, I daresay, with the most intense zeal for "improving myself", & the holiest affections, & 13 children, & no character or impetus—a love of long walks, of music; modest, yet conceited in an ant like way. I mean he has the industry & persistency in recounting compliments of an ant, but so little character that one hardly calls him vain!
Tuesday 25 May	The heat has come, bringing with it the inexplicably disagreeable memories of parties, & George Duckworth; a fear haunts me even now, as I drive past Park Lane on top of a bus, & think of Lady Arthur Russell & so on. I become out of love with everything; but fall into love as the bus reaches Holborn. A curious transition that, from tyranny to freedom. Mixed with it is the usual "I thought that when you died last May, Charles, there had died along with you"-death being hidden among the leaves: & Nessa's birthday among the little hard pink rosettes of the may, which we used to stop & smell on the pavement at the top of Hyde Pk. Gate & I asked why, if it was may, it did not come out on the 1st; it comes out now, & Nessa's birthday, which must be her 47th, is in a few days. She is in Italy: Duncan is said to have "committed a nuisance" for which he has been fined 10 lira.	L. has been having Nelly's poisonous cold, brought by Lottie-Do I hear him? Grizzle says Yes: stands tail wagging-She is right. Vita has it; or I should be dining-	Now we have been sitting in the Square. L. is better. I am happier. Tomorrow we go to Rodmell-to find the bath & the W.C. & the drawing room with the wall pulled down. This cherry has been dangled & withdrawn so often that I scarcely believe we shall now munch it. And I must notice that the Strike still makes it necessary for me to find out trains at Victoria.	I have finished-sketchily I admit-the 2nd part of To the Lighthouse-& may, then, have it all written over by the end of July. A record-7 months, if it so turns out.	So Vita came: & I register the shock of meeting after absence; how shy one is; how disillusioned by the actual body; how sensitive to new shades of tone-something 'womanly' I detected, more mature; & she was shabbier, come straight off in her travelling clothes; & not so beautiful, as sometimes perhaps; & so we sat talking on the sofa by the window, she rather silent, I chattering, partly to divert her attention from me; & to prevent her thinking "Well, is this all?" as she was bound to think, having declared herself so openly in writing. So that we each registered some disillusionment; & perhaps also acquired some grains of additional solidity-This may well be more lasting than the first rhapsody. But I compared her state, justly, to a flock of birds flying hither thither, escaped, confused: returning, after a long journey, to the middle of things again. She was quieter, shyer, awkwarder than usual even. She has no ready talk-confronted by Nelly or Mrs Cartwright she stands like a schoolgirl. I think it quite likely she will get Harold out of his job. But then, as I always feel, with her 'grand life', Dotties & so on, whom I don't know at all, there may be many parts of her perfectly unillumined. But I cannot write. For the most part I can write. Suddenly the word instinct leaves me. This is the permanent state of most people no doubt. Maynard met George & Lady M[argaret]. at the Darwins. He is a humbug & she a fiend,he writes. She now walks with a stick. What a dreary world it is-these bubbles meeting once in 20 years or so.
Wednesday 9 June	Then I got the flue, last Saturday; sat shivering at Lords, in the hot sunshine; so have seen no one, except basement dwellers, & put off Don Giovanni, Dadie & Hope tonight, & Osbert [Sitwell]'s dinner tomorrow. All my bubbling up faculty at once leaves me. I grind out a little of that eternal How to read, lecture, as the Yale Review has bought it, & cannot conceive what The Lighthouse is all about. I hope to whip my brains up either at Vita's or Rodmell this weekend.	Yes, Rodmell is a perfect triumph, I consider—but L. advises me not to say so. In particular, our large combined drawing eating room, with its 5 windows, its beams down the middle, & flowers & leaves nodding in all round us. The bath boils quickly; the water closets gush & surge (not quite sufficiently though). The weather again failed us, & we had a queer journey home, via Newhaven, Peacehaven & Brighton. Trains slow & scarce. The Strike, I should say, continues. We then went to a party at Edith Sitwell's (I in my new dress) 'to meet Miss Stein', a lady much like John Fry, but more massive; in blue-sprinkled brocade, rather formidable. There was Morgan, Siegfried [Sassoon], Todd—to whom I proposed, wildly, fantastically, a book—which she accepts!—(& Viola so much criticised in the austere heights of Ham Spray) & Edith distraught; & cherries in handfulls, & barley water—as L. described it very brilliantly to Sybil the next day. She came: no one else; we sat & laughed—& wheres the harm in this stupidish, kindly, rather amusing woman, I asked? Then she expressed a wish to dine with us. L. is lunching with Wells today.	Leonard back from Wells who chattered till 1/4 to 4: likes to walk through the streets; has a house in France kept for him by a very intelligent Brazilian lady. Called me "too intelligent—a bad thing": can't criticise; brings in social theories, because he says in an age when society is dissolving, the social state is part of the character. They lunched at Boulesteins. Leonard asked for him at the Automobile Club; "A very famous name" said the man. And the warmth & clamour of Wells' fame seems to reach me, this chilly rainy evening; & I see how, if I stayed there, as he asks us, he would overwhelm me. (We are very hungry, by the way; Nelly is preparing a nice roast chicken & ices for dinner, which I shall enjoy. Then we shall play the Gramophone). I'm cheering up after my attack I'm glad to say, though a little undecided whether to stay with Vita or go to Monks House.	L. is going to make a book of his essays. I think of asking Lady Horner to write her memoirs. Today we discussed the date of Nelly's holiday—& so we go on.
Thursday 22 July	The summer hourglass is running out rapidly & rather sandily. Many nights I wake in a shudder thinking of some atrocity of mine. I bring home minute pinpricks which magnify in the middle of the night into gaping wounds. However, I drive my pen through de Quincey of a morning, having put The Lighthouse aside till Rodmell. There all virtue, all good, is in retreat. Here nothing but odds & ends—going to the dentist, buying combs; having Maynard & Bob to tea, & then Ralph & Frances to dinner, followed by Eddie & Kitchen [C. H. B. Kitchin]. But we are both jaded, & get no clear impression any more from the human face—must dine with Osbert Sitwell tonight though, & go to Hardy tomorrow. This is human life: this is the infinitely precious stuff issued in a narrow roll to us now, & then withdrawn for ever; & we spend it thus. Days without definite sensation are the worst of all. Days when one compells oneself to undergo this or that for some reason—but what reason?	There is nothing important at the moment to record: or if so, & one's state of mind is overwhelmingly important, I leave that, too for Rodmell. There I shall come to grips with the last part of that python, my book; it is a tug & a struggle, & I wonder now & then, why I let myself in for it. Rose Macaulay said "What else would one do with one's thoughts?" I have not seen her again nor Gwen, nor written to Violet [Dickinson]; nor learnt French, nor finished Clarissa.	Desmond came in; talked about Shakespeare. Now to settle my mind to Suspiria.
Saturday 31 July	My Own Brain	Here is a whole nervous breakdown in miniature. We came on Tuesday. Sank into a chair, could scarcely rise; everything insipid; tasteless, colourless. Enormous desire for rest. Wednesday—only wish to be alone in the open air. Air delicious—avoided speech; could not read. Thought of my own power of writing with veneration, as of something incredible, belonging to someone else; never again to be enjoyed by me. Mind a blank. Slept in my chair. Thursday. No pleasure in life whatsoever; but felt perhaps more attuned to existence. Character & idiosyncracy as Virginia Woolf completely sunk out. Humble & modest. Difficulty in thinking what to say. Read automatically, like a cow chewing cud. Slept in chair. Friday. Sense of physical tiredness; but slight activity of the brain. Beginning to take notice. Making one or two plans. No power of phrase making. Difficulty in writing to Lady Colefax. Saturday (today) much clearer & lighter. Thought I could write, but resisted, or found it impossible. A desire to read poetry set in on Friday. This brings back a sense of my own individuality. Read some Dante & Bridges, without troubling to understand, but got pleasure from them. Now I begin to wish to write notes, but not yet novel. But today senses quickening. No 'making up' power yet; no desire to cast scenes in my book. Curiosity about literature returning: want to read Dante, Havelock Ellis, & Berlioz autobiography; also to make a looking glass with shell frame. These processes have sometimes been spread over several weeks.	Proportions Changed	That in the evening, or on colourless days, the proportions of the landscape change suddenly. I saw people playing stoolball in the meadow: they appeared sunk far down on a flat board; & the downs raised high up, & mountainous round them. Detail was smoothed out. This was an extremely beautiful effect; the colours of the womens dresses also showing very bright & pure in the almost untinted surroundings. I knew, also, that the proportions were abnormal—as if I were looking between my legs.	Second Rate Art	i.e. C. by Maurice Baring. Within its limits, it is not second rate, or there is nothing markedly so, at first go off. The limits are the proof of its non-existence.. He can only do one thing: himself to wit; charming, clean, modest sensitive Englishman: outside that radius, & it does not carry far nor illumine much, all is—as it should be; light, sure, proportioned, affecting even; told in so well bred a manner that nothing is exaggerated, all related, proportioned. I could read this for ever, I said. L. said one would soon be sick to death of it.	Wandervögeln	of the sparrow tribe. Two resolute, sunburnt, dusty girls, in jerseys & short skirts, with packs on their backs, city clerks, or secretaries, tramping along the road in the hot sunshine at Ripe. My instinct at once throws up a screen, which condemns them: I think them in every way angular, awkward & self assertive. But all this is a great mistake. These screens shut me out. Have no screens, for screens are made out of our own integument; & get at the thing itself, which has nothing whatever in common with a screen. The screen making habit, though, is so universal, that probably it preserves our sanity. If we had not this device for shutting people off from our sympathies, we might, perhaps, dissolve utterly. Separateness would be impossible. But the screens are in the excess; not the sympathy.	Returning Health	This is shown by the power to make images: the suggestive power of every sight and word is enormously increased. Shakespeare must have had this to an extent which makes my normal state the state of a person blind, deaf, dumb, stone-stockish & fish-blooded. And I have it compared with poor Mrs Bartholomew almost to the extent that Shre has it compared with me.
Sunday 5 September	So it will be done, written over that is, in 3 weeks, I forecast, from today. What emerges? At this moment I'm casting about for an end. The problem is how to bring Lily & Mr R[amsay]. together & make a combination of interest at the end. I am feathering about with various ideas. The last chapter which I begin tomorrow is In the Boat: I had meant to end with R. climbing on to the rock. If so, what becomes [of] Lily & her picture? Should there be a final page about her & Carmichael looking at the picture & summing up R.'s character? In that case I lose the intensity of the moment. If this intervenes, between R. & the lighthouse, there's too much chop & change, I think. Could I do it in a parenthesis? so that one had the sense of reading the two things at the same time?	I shall solve it somehow, I suppose. Then I must go in to the question of quality. I think it may run too fast & free, & so be rather thin. On the other hand, I think it is subtler & more human than J[acob's] R[oom] & Mrs D[alloway]. And I am encouraged by my own abundance as I write. It is proved, I think, that what I have to say is to be said in this manner. As usual, side stories are sprouting in great variety as I wind this up: a book of characters; the whole string being pulled out from some simple sentence, like Clara Pater's, "Don't you find that Barker's pins have no points to them?" I think I can spin out all their entrails this way; but it is hopelessly undramatic. It is all in oratio obliqua. Not quite all; for I have a few direct sentences. The lyric portions of To the L. are collected in the 10 year lapse, & dont interfere with the text so much as usual. I feel as if it fetched its circle pretty completely this time: & I dont feel sure what the stock criticism will be. Sentimental? Victorian?	Then I must begin to plan out my book on literature for the Press. Six chapters. Why not groups of ideas, under some single heading—for example. Symbolism. God. Nature. Plot. Dialogue. Take a novel & see what the component parts are. Separate this, & bring under them instances of all the books which display them biggest. Probably this would pan out historically. One could spin a theory which wd bring the chapters together. I don't feel that I can read seriously[?] & exactly for it. Rather I want to sort out all the ideas that have accumulated in me.	Then I want to write a bunch of 'Outlines' to make money (for under a new arrangement, we're to share any money over £200 that I make): this I must leave rather to chance, according to what books come my way. I am frightfully contented these last few days, by the way. I dont quite understand it. Perhaps reason has something to do with it. Charleston & Tilton knocked me off my perch for a moment: Nessa & her children: Maynard & his carpets. My own gifts & shares seemed so moderate in comparison; my own fault too—a little more self control on my part, & we might have had a boy of 12, a girl of 10: This always rakes me wretched in the early hours. So I said, I am spoiling what I have. And thereupon settled [?] to exploit my own possessions to the full; I can make money & buy carpets; I can increase the pleasure of life enormously by living it carefully. No doubt, this is a rationalisation of a state which is not really of that nature. Probably I am very lucky. Mrs Allinson says she would like to look like me. Mary says I'm the only woman she loves. Nelly cooks admirably. Then, I am extremely happy walking on the downs. I dont want to be talking to Eddy at Charleston. I like to have space to spread my mind out in. Whatever I think, I can rap out, suddenly to L. We are somehow very detached, free, harmonious. I don't in the least want to hurry up & finish the time here. I want to go to Seaford & walk back over the downs; to go & see the house at East Chiltington; to breathe in more light & air; to see more grey hollows & gold cornfields & the first ploughed land shining white, with the gulls flickering. No: I dont want anyone to come here & interrupt. I am immensely busy. Hence I come to my moral, which is simply to enjoy what one does enjoy, without teasing oneself oh but Nessa has children, Maynard carpets. I might go & stay with Ethel [Sands, in Normandy]. For my own wishes are always definite enough to give me a lead, one way or another; & the chief joy in life is to follow these lights; I am now almost entirely surrounded by sheep. God knows, I wish we could buy the terrace, & have a garden all round the lodge—but this is not a serious diminution of joy.	Clive & Mary came over yesterday in brilliant sun. We sat on the millstones. (one sheep has a tail like a bell-rope—the others are all bit short.) Wells. Hardy. Maynard. Richardson. [word illegible]. Christabel—going to Greece for a month with Lesley Jowitt. Maupassant's metaphors — The Questionnaire. Lytton's harem—Their dulness—Carrington a cook who doesn't go out on Sundays. Whether Eddy is clever or not. Tonks & Steer & Moore—Tonks in love with Mary, Clive insists; she is modest. So we talked. Then I drove with them to the Laye, walked up the down behind Asheham & let all that wind & sun blow through the crazy sails of my old windmill, which gives me so much pleasure still. I forget what I thought about: did not think, I suppose; was all in a thrill of emotion at my being liked by Mary & being a success, &c. Home to music, my new 15/- table, talk with L.: a sense of great happiness & ease. Went & looked at the stars, but could not get quite the right sense of amazement (I can get this really well at times) because L. said	"Now come in. Its too cold to be out"
Monday 13 September	The blessed thing is coming to an [end] I say to myself with a groan. Its like some prolonged rather painful & yet exciting process of nature, which one desires inexpressibly to have over. Oh the relief of waking & thinking its done—the relief, & the disappointment, I suppose. I am talking of To the Lighthouse. I am exacerbated by the fact that I spent 4 days last week hammering out de Quincey, which has been lying about since June; so refused £30 to write on Willa Cather; & now shall be quit in a week I hope of this unprofitable fiction, & could have wedged in Willa before going back. So I should have had £70 of my years 200 ready made by October: (my greed is immense: I want to have £50 of my own in the Bank to buy Persian carpets, pots, chairs &c.) Curse Richmond, Curse The Times, Curse my own procrastinations & nerves. I shall do Cobden Sanderson & Mrs Hemans & make something by them however. As for the book [To the Lighthouse]— Morgan said he felt 'This is a failure' as he finished The passage to India. I feel—what? A little stale this last week or two from steady writing. But also a little triumphant. If my feeling is correct, this is the greatest stretch I've put my method to, & I think it holds. By this I mean that I have been dredging up more feelings & character, I imagine. But Lord knows, until I look at my haul. This is only my own feeling in process. Odd how I'm haunted by that damned criticism of Janet Case's "its all dressing. . . technique. (Mrs Dalloway). The C.R. has substance". But then in ones strained state any fly has liberty to settle, & its always the gadflies. Muir praising me intelligently has comparatively little power to encourage—when I'm working that is—when the ideas halt. And this last lap, in the boat, is hard, because the material is not so rich as it is with Lily on the lawn: I am forced to be more direct & more intense. I am making some use of symbolism, I observe; & I go in dread of 'sentimentality'. Is the whole theme open to that charge? But I doubt that any theme is in itself good or bad. It gives a chance to ones peculiar qualities—thats all. Then I'm concerned whether to stay with Ethel Sands or not: whether to buy a dress or not. Then I'm astonishingly happy in the country—a state of mind which, if I did not dislike hyphens, I should hyphen, to show that it is a state by itself.	We took Angus over the downs towards Falmer yesterday. After all these years, we have discovered some of the loveliest, loneliest, most surprising downland in these parts: lovelier I think than our rival the Seaford-Tilton down over which we walked in broiling sun last Thursday. How it beat on our heads, made poor puppy pant. Lydia & Maynard came to tea.
Thursday 14 May	The first day of summer, leaves visibly drawing out of the bud, & the Square almost green. Oh what a country day—& some of my friends are now reading Mrs D. in the country.	I meant to register more of my books temperatures. C.R. does not sell; but is praised. I was really pleased to open the Manchester Guardian this morning & read Mr Fausset on The Art of V.W. Brilliance combined with integrity; profound as well as eccentric. Now if only the Times would speak out thus, but the Times mumbles & murmurs like a man sucking pebbles—did I say that I had nearly 2 mumbling columns on me there? But the odd thing is this: honestly I am scarcely a shade nervous about Mrs D. Why is this? Really I am a little bored, for the first time, at thinking how much I shall have to talk about it this summer. The truth is that writing is the profound pleasure & being read the superficial. I'm now all on the strain with desire to stop journalism & get on to To the Lighthouse. This is going to be fairly short: to have father's character done complete in it; & mothers; & St Ives; & childhood; & all the usual things I try to put in—life, death &c. But the centre is father's character, sitting in a boat, reciting We perished, each alone, while he crushes a dying mackerel—However, I must refrain. I must write a few little stories first, & let the Lighthouse simmer, adding to it between tea & dinner till it is complete for writing out.	Yesterday was a terrific chatter day—Desmond on top of Dr Leyes, Lord Olivier on top of Desmond, James & Dadie to finish off with, while L. had I forget how many press interviews & committees into the bargain. The League of Nations is booming (Innes, I mean.) But I meant to describe my dear old Desmond, whom it rejoiced me to see again, & he held out both his hands, & I set him in his chair & we talked till 7 o'clock. He is rather worn & aged; a little, I think, feeling that here's 45 on him & nothing achieved, except indeed the children, whom he dotes on—Micky to write, Dermod & Rachel trilling & warbling on flute & piano: all his human relations very fertile & flourishing, but oh, he said, talking of Houseman, don't let him give up the Corn Exchange & take to literature! I saw him thinking of his 50 articles for 5 years, his welter of old articles lying dusty in boxes, & now Geoffrey Scott promoted to do Donne, which Desmond should have done in the year 1912. I remember him telling me the story at Brunswick Square. So I said I would take the thing in hand & see it through which touched him, for children are not enough, after all; one wants something to be made out of oneself alone—& 5 boxes of dusty articles are rather raggy & rotten for 45 years. And he praised the C.R. with enthusiasm; & will write on it, & so we chattered along; Vernon Lee, with her cheap rings in exquisite taste; & her idiomatic Italian; & her spiteful way of seeing things, so that she dare not write her memoirs; Lily Langtry coming down the playhouse steps & her daughter looming behind her, loveliness that "struck me in the breast"; also Logan & Ottoline—how Alys is ill of the cancer again—"a most unhappy miserable life poor woman—" L. having the new Mrs B.R. on one side, would be chafed to death by Ott. next door; but like a fool, Logan made none of this clear, & only complained that the village peace of Chelsea would be destroyed by O. wh. naturally she resented. In all this, Desmond acts as solvent & go between, everyone sponging on his good nature & sense. What else did we discuss? The E[lizabe]thans? The Phoenix; poor Ray Litvin's miserable big mouth, & little body; when L. came, & then the dinner party, I just having time for a race round the Square; both Dadie & James very easy & affable, indeed for Dadie I feel considerable affection—so sensitive & tender is he, & one of these days will get a pull on himself, & be less of a quicksilver. Indeed, staying on he talked very seriously & excitedly of his dissertation & poets use of words, how they fix on to a word & fill it out with meaning & make it symbolic. But what these scholars want is to get at books through writing books, not through reading them.	But I must remember to write about my clothes next time I have an impulse to write. My love of clothes interests me profoundly: only it is not love; & what it is I must discover.
Saturday 30 October	It will be when may I come & see you!—too true a prophecy, though made in the damp & solitude of Rodmell. Monday, Ozzie Dickinson, Wednesday, Lady Colefax, Thursday Morgan to meet Abel Chevalley, dine Wells to meet Arnold Bennett, Friday to Monday Long Barn. So the week slips or sticks through my fingers; rage misery joy, dulness elation mix: I am the usual battlefield of emotions; alternately think of buying chairs & clothes; plod with some method revising To the Lighthouse; quarrel with Nelly (who was to catch the afternoon train today because I told a lie about a telephone) & so we go on. Maurice Baring & the Sitwells send me their books; Leonard forges ahead, now doing what he calls "correspondence"; the Press creaks a little at its hinges; Mrs C[artwright]. has absconded with my spectacles: I find Buggers bores; like the normal male; & should now be developing my book for the Press. All these things shoulder each other out across the screen of my brain. At intervals, I begin to think (I note this, as I am going to watch for the advent of a book) of a solitary woman musing[?] a book of ideas about life. This has intruded only once or twice, & very vaguely: it is a dramatisation of my mood at Rodmell. It is to be an endeavour at something mystic, spiritual; the thing that exists when we aren't there.	Among external things, we were at Cambridge for the week end; kept warm at the Bull—& there's a good subject—The Hotel. Many people from Macclesfield talking about motor cars. Mothers, to me pathetic, looking half shyly at their sons, as if deprecating their age. A whole life opened to me: father, mother, son, daughter. Father alone has wine. An enormous man, like an advertisement of Power: sits in chair. Daddy you'll be miserable in it says girl, herself bovine. Mother a mere wisp; sits with eyes shut; had spent hours driving up writing characters of maids. Shall I remember any of this?	Then Gosse introducing Vita at Royal —— something. I never saw the whole hierarchy of lit. so plainly exposed. Gosse the ornament on the tea pot: beneath him file on file of old stout widows whose husbands had been professors, beetle specialists doubtless, meritorious dons; & these good people, ruminating tea, & reflecting all the depths of the suburbs tinctured with literature, dear Vita told them were "The Hollow Men." Her address was read in sad sulky tones like those of a schoolboy; her pendulous rich society face, glowing out under a black hat at the end of the smoky dismal room, looked very ancestral & like a picture under glass in a gallery. She was fawned upon by the little dapper grocer Gosse, who kept spinning round on his heel to address her compliments & to scarify Bolshevists; in an ironical voice which seemed to ward off what might be said of him; & to be drawing round the lot of them thicker & thicker, the red plush curtains of respectability. There was Vita, who was too innocent to see it, Guedalla, & Drinkwater. I dont regret my wildest, foolishest, utterance, if it gave the least crack to this respectability. But needless to say, no word of mine has had any effect whatever. Gosse will survive us all. Now how does he do it? Yet he seemed to me, with his irony & his scraping, somehow uneasy. A kind of black doormat got up & appeared to be Lady Gosse. So home, with Dotty in a rage, because she was palmed off with Plank. She did contrive to get here though in the end. One night I went in with Vita after the play. She was lying asleep at Mount Street, in a flat at the top of the house: large pale furniture about dimly seen—a dog on her bed. She woke up chattering & hysterical. Virginia Woolf Virginia Woolf My God! Virginia Woolf is in the room. For Gods Sake Vita dont turn the lights on. No light you fool! But I cant see to get the allella, mumbled Vita. She got it though. We sat & drank. Dusky shapes of glasses & things, a room I had never seen; a woman I scarcely knew; Vita there between us, intimate wi' both; flattery, extravagance, complete inner composure on my part, & so home.
Tuesday 23 November	Here I must resolve first of all to find some long solid book to read. What? Tristram Shandy? French memoirs? This is on top of a discussion, at tea about Angus. He dont do, L. says: will never make a manager. So then shall it be another attempt, or Cape, or Secker? These difficulties recur. I should not much like writing for Cape; yet if the Press is sagging on our shoulders, there is little sense in waiting on. Next year L. thinks we could sell to advantage. It gives one a full life: but then life is so full already. Colefax complicates the scene—Colefax is the death of this book. Aren't I always reading her scrawls or answering them. This culminated last week in her dining alone with me, off cold chicken. I found us talking socially, not intimately, she in pearls (shams Vita says) popping up one light after another: like the switch board at the telephone exchange at the mention of names. Geoffrey Scott, Percy Lubbock[,] whoever it might be. Perfectly competent, &, for her purpose, efficient. She is, I maintain, a woman of the world: has all her senses tuned to that pitch. The machine doesn't work in private, though she was very anxious, poor aspiring, slightly suspicious & uneasy woman, that it should. She told me how she had lived till she married running after old ladies with their knitting. So, on marriage, but she was only 19, had kicked her heels up: determined to live, like Violet's mother, who leant out of the Palace window at Auckland & said, to an old man selling kippers, Is this life? But now, aged 50, she asks, Is this life? again—rushing round, dining & giving dinners; never able to concentrate in a corner, & secretly, in my opinion, not desiring it but pretending it, as she has the habit of pretence. This is all right in her, but wrong in me. So we don't altogether amalgamate; but I have my reservations, she hers. In came Dadie, to our relief, somewhat; then Sir Arthur, breezy, cheery, competent, patting her, controlling her, petted by her (she reverted to her arch girlish days, when she could eat soup & potatoes without any thought of her figure) sitting on the edge of my shabby dirty down at heels arm chair.	All this rushes on apace. Fame grows. Chances of meeting this person, doing that thing, accumulate. Life is as I've said since I was 10, awfully interesting—if anything, quicker, keener at 44 than 24—more desperate I suppose, as the river shoots to Niagara—my new vision of death; active, positive, like all the rest, exciting; & of great importance—as an experience.	'The one experience I shall never describe' I said to Vita yesterday. She was sitting on the floor in her velvet jacket & red striped silk shirt, I knotting her pearls into heaps of great lustrous eggs. She had come up to see me—so we go on—a spirited, creditable affair, I think, innocent (spiritually) & all gain, I think; rather a bore for Leonard, but not enought to worry him. The truth is one has room for a good many relationships. Then she goes back again to Persia, with Leigh Ashton—that putty faced low voiced rather beaten cur, who is always slinking off with his tail between his legs, but gives, they say, oyster suppers.	I am re-doing six pages of Lighthouse daily. This is not I think, so quick as Mrs D.: but then I find much of it very sketchy, & have to improvise on the typewriter. This I find much easier than re-writing in pen & ink. My present opinion is that it is easily the best of my books, fuller than J.'s R. & less spasmodic, occupied with more interesting things than Mrs D. & not complicated with all that desperate accompaniment of madness. It is freer & subtler I think. Yet I have no idea yet of any other to follow it: which may mean that I have made my method perfect, & it will now stay like this, & serve whatever use I wish to put it to. Before, some development of the method brought fresh subjects in view, because I saw the chance of being able to say them. Yet I am now & then haunted by some semi mystic very profound life of a woman, which shall all be told on one occasion; & time shall be utterly obliterated; future shall somehow blossom out of the past. One incident—say the fall of a flower—might contain it. My theory being that the actual event practically does not exist—nor time either. But I dont want to force this. I must make up my Series book.
Saturday 11 December	I have never been able to afford 2/ for a good piece of washleather, yet I buy a dozen boxes of matches for 1/6.	I am giving up the hope of being well dressed.	Violet Dickinson has just had a third serious operation & I went to an old Curiosity shop instead of going to see her.	Leonard is lunching with Maynard & a great registered parcel has just been delivered containing Dadie's dissertation.	It is now close on 3.30. Some superstition prevents me from reading Yeats' autobiography as I should like. I am very happy at the moment: having arranged my week on the whole well. But I have been rather unscupulous. I have put off the Stephens, at Thorpe: & shall probably stay at Knole.	A few thoughts to fill up time waiting for dinner. An article all about London: How Vita's inkpot flowered on her table. Logan's vanity: I write everything 8 times—	(So thats how its done I thought: he thought thats the only way to produce writing like mine)	But all my thoughts perish instantly. I make them up so vast. How to blunt the sting of an unpleasant remark: to say it over & over & over again. Walked to Violet's; took her a red carnation & a white one. My feelings quickened as I drew near. I visualised the operation as I stood on the doorstep.	I also have made up a passage for The Lighthouse: on people going away & the effect on one's feeling for them.	But reading Yeats turns my sentences one way: reading Sterne turns them another.
Friday 14 January	This is out of order, but I have no new book, & so must record here (& it was here I recorded the beginning of The Lighthouse) must record here the end. This moment I have finished the final drudgery. It is now complete for Leonard to read on Monday. Thus I have done it some days under the year, & feel thankful to be out of it again. Since October 25th I have been revising & retyping (some parts 3 times over) & no doubt I should work at it again; but I cannot. What I feel is that it is a hard muscular book, which at this age proves that I have something in me. It has not run out & gone flabby, at least such is my feeling before reading it over.	Sunday 23 January	Well Leonard has read To the Lighthouse, & says it is much my best book, & it is a 'masterpiece'. He said this without my asking. I came back from Knole & sat without asking him. He calls it entirely new 'a psychological poem', is his name for it. An improvement upon Dalloway: more interesting. Having won this great relief, my mind dismisses the whole thing, as usual; & I forget it, & shall only wake up & be worried again over proofs & then when it appears.	We went to Cornwall (dare I characterise Will hearing him talk next door—it is Sunday—he is dining with us). He is a water-blooded waspish little man, all on edge, vain, peevish, nervous. Ka is matronly, but substantial. Some views I retain—one of the valley in the evening light—but others were only a dull impression of life suspended & frozen, & the chin sawing of Mervyn: all chapped, becolded. We came home for these reasons a day early, & next morning I had a letter from the New York H[erald]. & T[ribune] asking me to go there, passage paid, 120 in my pocket &, perhaps, expenses, & write 4 articles. We accepted, on conditions; but have not heard yet. Meanwhile we hesitate, for if Leonard came, we should probably be £150 out of pocket. So it seems. The adventure is tempting. But the grind of moneymaking is scarcely to be endured unnecessarily. We could go to Greece, or Italy for less.	Then Nessa has gone, poor dear creature. I came in two days ago & found her white at the telephone; Elly at the other end saying that Duncan's illness was probably typhoid. I think a left handed marriage makes these moments more devastating: a sense remains, I think of hiding one's anguish; of insecurity. Angus writes the most cautious alarming letters. Anyhow she went yesterday in a snowstorm, & we kissed on the pavement in the snow. We are very intimate—a great solace to me. Vita goes on Saturday. Tomorrow I dine with her at Colefaxes: a brilliant party: no clothes: hair down my back as usual. Does it very much matter? I reached that point of philosophy at Knole the other night, with the bountiful womanly Mrs Rubens & his Lordship the figure of an English nobleman, decayed, dignified, smoothed, effete; respectable I think in his modest way. But I never have enjoyed a party. Balls at Buckingham Palace are worth looking at. He spends the day sitting on Com[mi]tees at Maidstone; interviews parsons about livings; likes chess & crime. Vita took me over the 4 acres of building, which she loves: too little conscious beauty for my taste: smallish rooms looking on to buildings: no views: yet one or two things remain: Vita stalking in her Turkish dress, attended by small boys, down the gallery, wafting them on like some tall sailing ship—a sort of covey of noble English life: dogs walloping, children crowding, all very free & stately: & [a] cart bringing wood in to be sawn by the great circular saw. How do you see that? I asked Vita. She said she saw it as something that had gone on for hundreds of years. They had brought wood in from the Park to replenish the great fires like this for centuries: & her ancestresses had walked so on the snow with their great dogs bounding by them. All the centuries seemed lit up, the past expressive, articulate; not dumb & forgotten; but a crowd of people stood behind, not dead at all; not remarkable; fair faced, long limbed; affable; & so we reach the days of Elizabeth quite easily. After tea, looking for letters of Dryden's to show me, she tumbled out a love letter of Ld Dorset's (17th century) with a lock of his soft gold tinted hair which I held in my hand a moment. One had a sense of links fished up into the light which are usually submerged. Otherwise no particular awe or any great sense of difference or distinction. They are not a brilliant race. The space & comeliness of it all struck me. I came home to Marjorie Strachey, Tom Eliot, Nessa & Roger. A little constricted our society: no talk of the clergy or of the country; but how lively & agile compared with the	[text ends]
Saturday 12 February	Exactly what has happened in the Clive Mary affair I cannot say. Did he not sheepishly admit in the kitchen the other night that he was putting it off till March? & then, casually & jauntily tell me as if by chance, the other afternoon, here, that he was going after all. But wont Mary mind? What if she does?—that was practically his answer.	Vita's prose is too fluent. I've been reading it, & it makes my pen run. When I've read a classic, I am curbed &—not castrated: no, the opposite; I cant think of the word at the moment.	Had I been writing P[assenger] to T[eheran] I should have run off whole pools of this coloured water; & then (I think) found my own method of attack. It is my distinction as a writer I think to get this clear & my expression exact. Were I writing travels I should wait till some angle emerged: & go for that. The method of writing smooth narrative cant be right; things dont happen in one's mind like that. But she is very skilful & golden voiced.	This makes me think that I have to read To the L. tomorrow & Monday, straight through in print; straight through, owing to my curious methods, for the first time. I want to read largely & freely once: then to niggle over details.	But I am forgetting, after 3 days, the most important event in my life since marriage—so Clive described it: Bobo shingled me. Mr Cizec has bingled me. I am short haired for life. Having no longer, I think, any claims to beauty, the convenience of this alone makes it desirable. Every morning I go to take up brush & twist that old coil round my finger & fix it with hairpins & then with a start of joy, no I needn't. In front there is no change; behind I'm like the rump of a partridge. This robs dining out of half its terrors; in token of which, I'm 'dining out' (the distinction is clear: Roger & Clive & Bloomsbury aint dining out) with Ethel [Sands] & with the [Hubert] Hendersons.	For the rest—its been a gay tropical kind of autumn, with so much Vita & Knole & staying away: we have launched ourselves a little more freely perhaps from work & the Press. But now with Nessa away, Clive away, Duncan away, Vita away, the strenuous time sets in: I'm reading & writing at a great pace; mean to 'do' Morgan; have a fling at my book on fiction; & make all the money we want for Greece & a motor car. I may note that the first symptoms of Lighthouse are unfavourable. Roger, it is clear did not like Time Passes. Harpers & the Forum have refused serial rights; Brace writes, I think, a good deal less enthusiastically than of Mrs D. But these opinions refer to the rough copy, unrevised. And anyhow I feel callous: L.'s opinion keeps me steady; I'm neither one thing nor the other.	Yesterday Wells asked us to publish a pamphlet for him. This is a great rise in the world for us; & comes on top of rather a flat talk with Angus. L. says he doesn't "manage". Angus refuses to budge an inch. He can't see the point of it. As he says, too, whats he to do if he leaves? He doesn't want to leave. Though sometimes 'fed up' he likes it better than most work. But I'm persuaded we need, the press needs, a fanatic at the moment; not this quiet easygoing gentlemanliness. I am annoyed at doing cards, & envelopes; & L. does twice the work I do.
Monday 28 February	& I have got into another stream of thought, if thought it can be called.	Let me collect a few logs, drifting in my mind, to represent the past few days. Clive, standing at the door. She cries for the moon. This was said of Mary. With it he went to Cassis for 3 months.	Again, If Mrs Woolf dont think me worth a penny stamp I said—this being Rose Bartholomew standing at her cottage door on Friday evening. Phrases suddenly seem to me very significant, & then I forget them. My brain is rather stale. Do I like The Lighthouse? I think I was disappointed. But God knows. I have to read it again.	A letter from Vita & Dottie just come. She is not an explicit letter writer. But I must be fond of her, genuinely, to start as I did at the sight of Dottie's hand, thinking she wrote to say V. was ill.	For the rest I think Cowper is a good poet. I'd like to write about him. Shall we go to Greece, Italy or France? I'm glad I didn't dedicate my book to Roger. This I verified in his presence, the other night [23 February]. He dined here with Raymond. Raymond is intellectually speaking underbred. Roger a pure aristocrat. Philip [Ritchie] came in, his little green eyes hazed bunged up with drink. So to Rodmell. And now the wind is making the tin screen over the gas fire rattle. How we protect ourselves from the elements! Coming back last night I thought, owing to civilisation, I, who am now cold, wet, & hungry, can be warm & satisfied & listening to a Mozart 4tet in 15 minutes. And so I was.	That ring may be Tom. No. Tom dont run upstairs—only the lower classes do that.	And I dont think I shall go out in the rain, though I am going to spend this week in long romantic London walks. I have successfully broken the neck of that screaming grey goose—society. There's nothing to be afraid of in dining with Ethel or Sibyl—& I'm shingled now. One spins round for a moment & then settles on one's feet. But about the Soul: the soul has sunk to the bottom. I am empty headed tonight, feeling the lack of Nessa rather, & all the prelude of Spring—the vague discomfort & melancholy & a feeling of having come to anchor. But I intend to work harder & harder. If they—the respectables, my friends, advise me against The Lighthouse, I shall write memoirs; have a plan already to get historical manuscripts & write Lives of the Obscure: but why do I pretend I should take advice? After a holiday the old ideas will come to me as usual; seeming fresher, more important than ever; & I shall be off again, feeling that extraordinary exhilaration, that ardour & lust of creation—which is odd, if what I create is, as it well may be, wholly bad.	Today I bought a new watch. Last night I crept into L.'s bed to make up a sham quarrel about paying our fares to Rodmell. Now to finish Passage to India.
Monday 21 March	This is the kind of evening when one seems to be abroad: the window is open; the yellows & greys of the houses seem exposed to the summer; there is that rumour & clamour which reminds one of Italy. Almost in a week now we shall be starting. I dislike the days before going. I went to buy clothes today & was struck by my own ugliness. Like Edith Sitwell I can never look like other people—too broad, tall, flat, with hair hanging. And now my neck is so ugly… But I never think of this at home.	How disturbing the summer is! We shall sit reading with the windows open tonight, but my mind will only just touch the page & float off. Something unsettled & melancholy will be in the air. Also it seems the threshold of that vast burning London summer, which alarms me slightly, Vita & Harold will be back; my book will be out. We shall sit in the Square. But I shall not let things worry me much. (so I say—but it is still only March.) We shall have a week at Cassis—a strange resurrection of us all abroad. Many years have gone since Nessa, Clive & I met there. Never with Leonard of course.	My brain is ferociously active. I want to have at my books as if I were conscious of the lapse of time, age & death. Dear me, how lovely some parts of The Lighthouse are! Soft & pliable, & I think deep, & never a word wrong for a page at a time. This I feel about the dinner party, & the children in the boat; but not of Lily on the lawn. That I do not much like. But I like the end.	I get too many letters to answer nowadays. Edith Sitwell came to tea: transparent like some white bone one picks up on a moor, with sea water stones on her long frail hands which slide into yours much narrower than one expects like a folded fan. She has pale gemlike eyes; & is dressed, on a windy March day, in three decker skirts of red spotted cotton. She half shuts her eyes; coos an odd little laugh, reminding me of the Fishers [VW's cousins]. All is very tapering & pointed, the nose running on like a mole. She said I was a great writer, which pleased me. So sensitive to everything in people & books she said. She got talking about her mother, blaspheming in the nursery, hysterical, terrible; setting Edith to kill bluebottles. 'But nobody can take a liberty with her' said Edith, who prides herself on Angevin blood. She is a curious product, likable to me: sensitive, etiolated, affectionate, lonely, having to thread her way (there is something ghostlike & angular about her) home to Bayswater to help cook dinner. She said she would like to attach great bags & balloons of psychology, people having dinner, &c, to her poems, but has no knowledge of human nature, only these sudden intense poems— which by the way she has sent me. In other ages she would have been a cloistered nun; or an eccentric secluded country old maid. It is the oddity of our time that has set her on the music hall stage. She trips out into the Limelight with all the timidity & hauteur of the aristocratic spinster.
Thursday 5 May	Book out. We have sold (I think) 1690 before publication—twice Dalloway. I write however in the shadow of the damp cloud of the Times Lit Sup. review, which is an exact copy of the JsR. Mrs Dalloway review, gentlemanly, kindly, timid & praising beauty, doubting character, & leaving me moderately depressed. I am anxious about Time Passes. Think the whole thing may be pronounced soft, shallow, insipid, sentimental. Yet, honestly, don't much care; want to be let alone to ruminate. Odd how strong this feeling is in me. Now I think we are safe to get our motor car. The next fortnight we shall both be depressed about our books.	Dined with the Wests last night, all solid, shiny, spread & spacious; as if they were settling in; wedding presents; clean covers, carpets, &c. all too handsome for my taste. I'm reverting to squalor as my milieu. And then why did she marry him? He is the type of any other cleverish young journalist, common, glib: unesy last night, lest we should talk of Angus. But we talked of Madge.	I know why I am depressed: a bad habit of making up the review I should like before reading the review I get. I am excited about my article on Poetry & Fiction. Writing for an audience always stirs me. I hope to avoid too many jokes. Then Vita will come tomorrow. But I dont want people: I want solitude; Rome.	Nelly away; Pinker [dog] away; Clive coming back; Opera in swing; Francis to see me about writing; fine spring weather.
Monday 16 May	The book. Now on its feet so far as praise is concerned. It has been out 10 days—Thursday a week ago. Nessa enthusiastic—a sublime, almost upsetting spectacle. She says it is an amazing portrait of mother; a supreme portrait painter; has lived in it; found the rising of the dead almost painful. Then Ottoline, then Vita, then Charlie [Sanger], then Lord Olivier, then Tommie, then Clive: poor Clive—he came in, ostensibly to praise this 'amazing book—far the best you've ever written' but found Eddie who imposed himself resolutely, sharply; & so sat on, but how wandering & unhappy. I have scarcely seen him in this mood ever before—like a person awaked from a sweet dream. But what is it? A disillusionment? A shock? He sees Mary. Has he lost faith? Has the dancing mist of rhapsody failed him—he who was based so solidly on such beef & beer or champagne rather. Suppose one woke & found oneself a fraud? It was part of my madness—that horror. But then as Clive said, you go mad but you bound up again—the inference being that he was to stay mad.	Sold 1802 of The L.: if it makes 3,000 I shall be as they This it did on July 13th say more than content. Mervyn [Arnold-Forster] dead—did I record; & I haunted for a time by the sight of his prim pinched face, with the nice blue eyes, so suddenly stilled: so unseasonably. The eye plays a large part in these affairs.
Monday 6 June (Whit Monday)	I have been in bed a week with a sudden & very sharp headache, & this is written experimentally to test my brain. It is a horrid dull damp Bank holiday morning—(here L. comes in & we spend fifteen minutes discussing advertisements. The L. has sold 2,200 & we are reprinting). Nessa says its ugly weather when I ring up to offer her half a bottle of turpentine to paint her cupboard with.	But I would like to learn to write a steady plain narrative style. Then perhaps I could catch up with the last few weeks; describe my visit to Oxford; & how I lunched with Clive & dined with Dadie & stood in the basement printing Gottstalk with a great sense of shade & shelter. I like the obscure anonymity of the Press better a good deal than I like Voltaire by Riding. And now, with Morgan's morganatic, evasive, elusive letter this morning, The Lighthouse is behind me: my headache over; & after a week at Rodmell, my freedom from inspection, my deep dive into my own mind will begin.	How odd, it comes into my mind, is Nessa & my jealousy of each other's clothes! I feel her, when I put on my smart black fringed cape, anguished for a second: did I get it from Champco? in the same way I run my eye over her Paris dress, & compare it with my last year's Brooke. Then she says she is going to wear earrings: I say at once that I will; this she resents. Yet, we are both fundamentally sensible, & soon recover from our umbrage.	I think, however, I am now almost an established figure—as a writer. They dont laugh at me any longer. Soon they will take me for granted. Possibly I shall be a celebrated writer. Anyhow, The Lighthouse is much more nearly a success, in the usual sense of the word, than any other book of mine.	A great knot of people came together suddenly last week, or the week before. Tom—so glad to gossip with me off handedly over a cup—no 6 cups—of tea; then he played the gramophone: & Logan, pink & spruce, doing his trick of culture & urbanity & good sense very efficiently. He had been evoking the spirit of Henry James with Desmond in Paris. (Sibyl, by the way, takes to herself all credit for that fund, I observe. Sibyl, Clive & Raymond say, has sold her soul to the devil, & he's now come to fetch it—This phrase is common to them both, & gives the measure of smart talk at lunch parties.) Lytton, too, I saw: an invalid after an attack of love, the most desperate since Duncan. We talked, with poor marble eyed Cynthia Noble attentive, as far as she can be, about the O'B. & his life. I often glide into intimacy with Lytton about books. He is enthusiastic, his mind bare, his attention extremely alive, about books; whereas, about love, its more cryptic. Dadie & Douglas were both starched & powdered like pasteboard young men at the ballet; legs quite straight; heads curled; shirts granulated; they were going on to Kitchin's party, to be bored, as they knew; but in perfect trim for it. This Lytton does not quite achieve. We dined ostentatiously rather, it being part of the game to order food from Fortnum & Mason's; part of the pathetic, rather attractive, yet also foolish, showing off, very youthful game of being precisely like other people.
Sunday 14 June	A disgraceful confession—this is Sunday morning, & just after ten, & here I am sitting down to write diary & not fiction or reviews, without any excuse, except the state of my mind. After finishing those two books, though, one can't concentrate directly on a new one; & then the letters, the talk, the reviews, all serve to enlarge the pupil of my mind more & more. I cant settle in, contract, & shut myself off. I've written 6 little stories, scrambled them down untidily, & have thought out, perhaps too clearly, To the Lighthouse. And both books so far are successful. More of Dalloway has been sold this month than of Jacob in a year. I think it possible we may sell 2,000. The Common one is making money this week. And I get treated at great length & solemnity by old gentlemen.	A powerful, heavy, light blue eyed woman of 50, Mrs Cartwright wants to succeed Murphy; & Murphy wants to stay. How people want work! How tremendous a pull a very little money has in the world! But what the solution is to be, & how we are to find it, I know not. Here I salute Leonard with unstinted, indeed childlike, adoration. Somehow he will gently & firmly decide the whole thing, while Angus & I wobble & prevaricate. But then I have a child's trust in Leonard. Waking this morning, rather depressed that Mrs D. did not sell yesterday, that we had Peter [Lucas], Eileen Power & Noll & Ray [Strachey] last night & found it hard work, & not a single compliment vouchsafed me, that I had bought a glass necklace for £1, that I had a sore throat & a streaming nose, rather under the weather, I say, I snuggled in to the core of my life, which is this complete comfort with L., & there found everything so satisfactory & calm that I revived myself, & got a fresh start; feeling entirely immune. The immense success of our life, is I think, that our treasure is hid away; or rather in such common things that nothing can touch it. That is, if one enjoys a bus ride to Richmond, sitting on the green smoking, taking the letters out of the box, airing the marmots, combing Grizzle, making an ice, opening a letter, sitting down after dinner, side by side, & saying "Are you in your stall, brother?"—well, what can trouble this happiness? And every day is necessarily full of it. If we depended upon making speeches, or money, or getting asked to parties—which reminds me of Ottoline's ghastly party the other night. What possessed me to talk all the time to Helen Anrep? Partly that the plethora of young men slightly annoys me. Really, I am not a good lioness. With all my vanity, I'm come now to be a little cynical, or why don't I so much relish the admiration of the Turners, Kitchins, & Gathorne Hardys? A woman is much more warmly sympathetic. She carries her atmosphere with her. And Ott.'s powers of hostesry are all worn threadbare. People sat about at great distances, & one had a sense of the clock ticking & Ott. saying This is a failure, a failure, & not knowing how to pick the pieces up.	Now I must answer Gerald Brenan, & read the Genji; for tomorrow I make a second £20 from Vogue. Did I say that I am rejected by Sybil? From being Sybil, she has become Lady Colefax. No invitations for a month.
Thursday 23 June	This diary shall batten on the leanness of my social life. Never have I spent so quiet a London summer. It is perfectly easy to slip out of the crush unobserved. I have set up my standard as an invalid, & no one bothers me. No one asks me to do anything. Vainly, I have the feeling that this is of my choice, not theirs; & there is a luxury in being quiet in the heart of chaos. Directly I talk & exert my wits in talk I get a dull damp rather headachy day. Quiet brings me cool clear quick mornings, in which I dispose of a good deal of work, & toss my brain into the air when I take a walk. I shall feel some triumph if I skirt a headache this summer.	I sat with Nessa in the Square yesterday. Angelica sends Pinker after a ball. Nessa & I sit on the seat & gossip. She is to see Mary; she is to go to old Bell's funeral. She is learning to motor. She has sold a picture. The point of Clive's affair is that Mary is in love with another. This point was carefully hidden before Easter. His vanity was careful to hide it: her discretion. So I got my version out of proportion. The truth is odd enough though. Unless she will bed with him he is distracted. That she will not do; yet, for lack of him, is distracted herself. The love affair rather increases on her side. It is said to be for someone low in the world. This inclines us to think it Lord Ivor. But the point is one for curiosity only.	Vita's book [The Land] verberates & reverberates in the Press. A prize poem—that's my fling at it— for with some relics of jealousy, or it may be of critical sense, I can't quite take the talk of poetry & even great poetry seriously. But the subject & the manner, so smooth, so mild, may be what I dislike; & perhaps I am corrupt. I wonder what I should think if I could get a cool look at some writing of my own.	Oh & Sibyl has dropped me: & I don't feel the fall.	What is then the abiding truth in this phantasmagoria, I ask myself, seeking as I often do some little nugget of pure gold. I think, often, I have the happiest of lives, in having discovered stability. Now one stable moment vanquishes chaos. But this I said in The Lighthouse. We have now sold, I think, 2555 copies.	I am distressed by my failure to make cigarettes. I had a lesson from a man in Francis Street—cant do a thing with my fingers. Angelica is expert with hers already. Nessa says all painters are: this is a perquisite they get thrown in with their gift.	And Adrian came to tea on Sunday, & fairly sparkled. At last I think he has emerged. Even his analysis will be over this year. At the age of 43 he will be educated & ready to start life. I remember Harry Stephen saying that he had his fingers on the gear—the Indian judgeship that is to say—about then. So we Stephens mature late. And our late flowers are rare & splendid. Think of my books, Nessa's pictures—it takes us an age to bring our faculties into play. And now I must write to Ethel Sands, & perhaps, go to the Ballet.
Monday 25 November	I merely add idly (ought I not to be correcting To the Lighthouse) that the difficulties with Nelly are to avoid an apology. She has weakened, & is now all out to catch us weakening. She wished L. many happy returns this morning. She came to me on Friday & asked me why I did not speak. I had some difficulty in being stiff & angry & saying that after her behaviour & accusations it was impossible. Mrs Hunt promises an abundance of permanent dailies, & so I think the die is cast. I have no doubt difficulties will begin, again; but not the old intolerable difficulties, no, no, never again.	I broadcast; & poured my rage hot as lava over Vita. She appeared innocent—I mean of telling H[ilda] M[atheson]. that I could easily cut my Brummell to bits. And then I discussed her friends, Vita's friends, & said that here, in their secondrateness, was the beginning of my alienation. I cant have it said "Vita's great friends— Dottie, Hilda & Virginia". I detest the 2ndrate schoolgirl atmosphere. She sat silent for the most part, & only said I was right. Harold had said the same. The thing to do is to check it. She cant stop what she's begun. And then in a hurry to Rodmell, where the roof is on, & the floor stretched with planks. The bedroom will be a lovely wonderful room what I've always hoped for.
Saturday 27 June	A bitter cold day, succeeding a chilly windy night, in which were lit all the Chinese lanterns of Roger's garden party. And I do not love my kind. I detest them. I pass them by. I let them break on me like dirty rain drops. No longer can I summon up that energy which when it sees one of these dry little sponges floating past, or rather stuck on the rock, sweeps round them, steeps them, infuses them, nerves them, & so finally fills them & creates them. Once I had a gift for doing this, & a passion, & it made parties arduous & exciting. So when I wake early now I luxuriate most in a whole day alone; a day of easy natural poses, a little printing, slipping tranquilly off into the deep water of my own thoughts navigating the underworld; & then replenishing my cistern at night with Swift. I am going to write about Stella & Swift for Richmond, as a sign of grace, after sweeping guineas off the Vogue counter. The first fruit of the C.R. (a book too highly praised now) is a request to write for the Atlantic Monthly. So I am getting pushed into criticism. It is a great stand by—this power to make large sums by formulating views on Stendhal & Swift.	Jack dined here last night; & we said how many years is it since we three were alone in a room together? he & Nessa & I, waiting for dinner, & a little nervous. I'm more nervous of these encounters than she is. She has a sweet cordiality (odd term to use) which impressed me, recalling mother, as she led him on; & laughed; so sincere, so quiet, & then, when we went on to Roger's rather dismal gathering, gay & spirited, kissing Chrissie & flirting with Mrs Anrep, so careless & casual & white-haired—but enough of this. The truth is I am too random headed to describe Jack, yet he is worth describing. He made us laugh of course. He said such Wallerish things. "There are two kinds of biography, my dear Ginia"—in his old opinionative sententious way with enormous emphasis. He is red-copper coloured, with a pouch under his chin which rests on his collar; trusty brown eyes, a little hazy now, & one ear deaf, he said, & proceeded to tell us how he is cured by a Swiss every year, & gives the Nuns who keep the clinic a box of chocolates, which they love, being underfed. He looks in at the window & sees them handing the box round, & picking in turn. Then he told us, driving back from Roger's—I insist upon paying this taxi my dear Leonard—how he sugared for moths last summer & caught perhaps 150—& the man he was with (on a fishing club) left his electric light on & the moths came & sat on the curtain. He exaggerates, illuminates, appreciates everyone very generously. L. thinks he "might become a bit of a bore". Then we discussed his writing an autobiography: upon which he became very intent, & almost emotional. "But could one tell the truth? About one's affairs with women? About one's parents? My mother now—she was a very able woman—we all owe her an awful lot—but hard." She said an odd thing to Nessa once—that she hated girls, especially motherless girls. "There you go very deep— It was the terror of her life— that she was losing her charm. She would never have a girl in the house. It was a tragedy. She was a very selfish woman." (But while I try to write, I am making up "To the Lighthouse"—the sea is to be heard all through it. I have an idea that I will invent a new name for my books to supplant "novel". A new —— by Virginia Woolf. But what? Elegy?)
Monday 20 July	Here the door opened, & Morgan came in to ask us out to lunch with him at the Etoile, which we did, though we had a nice veal & ham pie at home (this is in the classic style of journalists). It comes of Swift perhaps, the last words of which I have just written, & so fill up time here.	I should consider my work list now. I think a little story, perhaps a review, this fortnight; having a superstitious wish to begin To the Lighthouse the first day at Monks House. I now think I shall finish it in the two months there. The word 'sentimental' sticks in my gizzard (I'll write it out of me in a story—Ann Watkins of New York is coming on Wednesday to enquire about my stories). But this theme may be sentimental; father & mother & child in the garden: the death; the sail to the lighthouse. I think, though, that when I begin it I shall enrich it in all sorts of ways; thicken it; give it branches & roots which I do not perceive now. It might contain all characters boiled down; & childhood; & then this impersonal thing, which I'm dared to do by my friends, the flight of time, & the consequent break of unity in my design. That passage (I conceive the book in 3 parts: 1. at the drawing room window; 2. seven years passed; 3. the voyage:) interests me very much. A new problem like that breaks fresh ground in ones mind; prevents the regular ruts.	Last night Clive dined with us; & Nelly is rather waspish about it this morning; & tried to run away before Ottoline came; but it proved to be Adrian; & then we talked of cancer, & Clive got set, & Ottoline came, in tea kettle taffeta, all looped & scolloped & fringed with silver lace, & talked about Rupert & Jacques, & re- told, with emendations, the story of Ka & Henry Lamb & herself. She has been working over these old stories so often, that they hold no likeness to the truth—they are stale, managed, pulled this way & that, as we used to knead & pull the crumb of bread, till it was a damp slab. Then the old motor was heard hooting & there was Philip & Julian [Morrell], at which, at Julian that is, Clive cheered up, & was very brisk & obliging as he knows how. We argued the case of the aristocracy v. the middle class. I rather liked it. But one seldom says anything very profound. I like the sense of other people liking it, as I suppose the Morrells do, for they settle on us like a cloud of crows, once a week now. My vanity as a hostess is flattered. Sometimes a buttery crumb of praise is thrown to me—"Lady Desborough admires your books enormously—wants to meet you"—& then Clive, looking at my photographs in Vogue says of the one last year—"That is charming—but must be taken very long ago, I suppose"—so you see how I switch back from pleasure to pain, & time was when I should have ended the evening fast stuck in black despair, gone to bed like a diver with pursed lips shooting into oblivion. But enough, enough—I coin this little catchword to control my tendency to flower into phrase after phrase. Some are good though.	What shall I read at Rodmell? I have so many books at the back of my mind. I want to read voraciously & gather material for the Lives of the Obscure—which is to tell the whole history of England in one obscure life after another. Proust I should like to finish. Stendhal, & then to skirmish about hither & thither. These 8 weeks at Rodmell always seem capable of holding an infinite amount. Shall we buy the house at Southease? I suppose not.
Thursday 30 July	I am intolerably sleepy & annulled, & so write here. I do want indeed to consider my next book, but I am inclined to wait for a clearer head. The thing is I vacillate between a single & intense character of father; & a far wider slower book—Bob T. telling me that my speed is terrific, & destructive. My summer's wanderings with the pen have I think shown me one or two new dodges for catching my flies. I have sat here, like an improviser with his hands rambling over the piano. The result is perfectly inconclusive, & almost illiterate. I want to learn greater quiet, & force. But if I set myself that task, don't I run the risk of falling into the flatness of N[ight]. & D[ay].? Have I got the power needed if quiet is not to become insipid. These questions I will leave, for the moment, unanswered.	I should here try to sum up the summer, since August ends a season, spiritual as well as temporal. Well; business has been brisk. I don't think I get many idle hours now, the idlest being, oddly enough, in the morning. I have not forced my brain at its fences; but shall, at Rodmell. When the dull sleep of afternoon is on me, I'm always in the shop, printing, dissing addressing; then it is tea, & Heaven knows we have had enough visitors. Sometimes I sit still & wonder how many people will tumble on me without my lifting a finger: already, this week, uninvited, on the verge of the holidays too, have come Mary, Gwen, Julian & Quentin, Geoffrey Keynes, & Roger. Meanwhile we are dealing with Maynard. All Monday Murphy & I worked like slaves till 6 when I was stiff as a coal heaver. We get telegrams & telephones; I daresay we shall sell our 10,000. On Tuesday at 12.30 Maynard retires to St Pancras Registry office with Lydia, & Duncan to witness (against his will.) So that episode is over. But, dear me, I'm too dull to write, & must go & fetch Mr Dobrée's novel & read it, I think. Yet I have a thousand things to say. I think I might do something in To the Lighthouse, to split up emotions more completely. I think I'm working in that direction.
Saturday 5 September	And why couldn't I see or feel that all this time I was getting a little used up & riding on a flat tire? So I was, as it happened; & fell down in a faint at Charleston, in the middle of Q.'s birthday party: & then have lain about here, in that odd amphibious life of headache, for a fortnight. This has rammed a big hole in my 8 weeks which were to be stuffed so full. Never mind. Arrange whatever pieces come your way. Never be unseated by the shying of that undependable brute, life, hag ridden as she is by my own queer, difficult nervous system. Even at 43 I dont know its workings, for I was saying to myself, all the summer, "I'm quite adamant now. I can go through a tussle of emotions peaceably that two years ago even, would have raked me raw."	I have made a very quick & flourishing attack on To the Lighthouse, all the same—22 pages straight off in less than a fortnight. I am still crawling & easily enfeebled, but if I could once get up steam again, I believe I could spin it off with infinite relish. Think what a labour the first pages of Dalloway were! Each word distilled by a relentless clutch on my brain.	I took up the pen meaning to write on "Disillusionment". I have never had any illusion so completely burnt out of me as my illusion about the Richmonds. This they effected between 4 & 6 yesterday. But Elena has no beauty, no charm, no very marked niceness even! Any country parsons wife is her match. Her nose is red, her cheeks blowsed: her eyes without character. Even her voice & movements which used to be adorable, her distinction, her kindly charm—all have vanished; she is a thick, dowdy, obliterated woman, who has no feelings, no sympathies, prominences & angles are all completely razed bare. Seriously, one has doubts for her complete mental equipment. The conversation was practically imbecile: for instance: (E). I think I could get very fond of a house. But we are so lucky. There are some delightful people near. People who like the same sort of things we do. (B). We are very lucky. There are two fellows within 4 miles who were at Winchester with me. One went to Ceylon as a tea planter. They both farm now. Are you lucky in your clergyman? So much depends in the country on one's clergyman. (E). I really forget anything more from the lips of E. I believe it was all the same: how she would like a house with a piano: & they mean to retire & buy a house with a piano. She sees flowers, dogs, houses, people with the same quiet, stolid, almost coarse, at any rate dull indifference. Her hands are thick. She has a double chin. She wears a long American looking blueish coat, with a nondescript dowdy scarf, a white blouse, fastened with a diamond lizard—oh the colourlessness, drabness, & coldness of her personality—she whom I used to think arch & womanly & comforting! She is white haired too. Bruce is completely circular: round head, eyes, nose, paunch, mind. You can't stop him rolling from thing to thing. He never stops, he glides smoothly. It would shock him to mention writing, money, or people. All has to be dissolved in slang & kindliness.	Now the curious thing was that these qualities infected us both to such an extent that we were acutely miserable. I have sometimes felt the same when walking in the suburbs. Castello Avenue made me angry like this once. As for L. he was indignant. That human nature should sink so low, he said; & then that people should lead such aimless evil lives—the most despicable he could imagine. They took the colour, the sting, the individuality out of everything. And to think that I have ever wasted a thought upon what that goodtempered worldly little grocer thought of my writing! But E. is the great disillusionment. Partly on Thoby's account, partly through my own susceptibility to certain shades of female charm, I had still some glow at the thought of her. Now that glow is replaced by a solid tallow candle. And I feel, this morning, having pitched into bed exhausted, physically worn out, mentally bankrupt, scraped; whitewashed, cleaned. An illusion gone.
Tuesday 19 January	Vita having this moment (20 minutes ago—it is now 7) left me, what are my feelings? Of a dim November fog; the lights dulled & damped. I walked towards the sound of a barrel organ in Marchmont Street. But this will disperse; then I shall want her, clearly & distinctly. Then not—& so on. This is the normal human feeling, I think. One wants to finish sentences. One wants that atmosphere—to me so rosy & calm. She is not clever; but abundant & fruitful; truthful too. She taps so many sources of life: repose & variety, was her own expression, sitting on the floor this evening in the gaslight. We dined last night at the Ivy with Clive; & then they had a supper party, from which I refrained. Oh & mixed up with this is the invigoration of again beginning my novel, in the Studio, for the first time this morning. All these fountains play on my being & intermingle. I feel a lack of stimulus, of marked days, now Vita is gone; & some pathos, common to all these partings; & she has 4 days journey through the snow.
