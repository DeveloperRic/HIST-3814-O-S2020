Exactly what has happened in the Clive Mary affair I cannot say. Did he not sheepishly admit in the kitchen the other night that he was putting it off till March? & then, casually & jauntily tell me as if by chance, the other afternoon, here, that he was going after all. But wont Mary mind? What if she does?—that was practically his answer.

Vita's prose is too fluent. I've been reading it, & it makes my pen run. When I've read a classic, I am curbed &—not castrated: no, the opposite; I cant think of the word at the moment.

Had I been writing P[assenger] to T[eheran] I should have run off whole pools of this coloured water; & then (I think) found my own method of attack. It is my distinction as a writer I think to get this clear & my expression exact. Were I writing travels I should wait till some angle emerged: & go for that. The method of writing smooth narrative cant be right; things dont happen in one's mind like that. But she is very skilful & golden voiced.

This makes me think that I have to read To the L. tomorrow & Monday, straight through in print; straight through, owing to my curious methods, for the first time. I want to read largely & freely once: then to niggle over details.

But I am forgetting, after 3 days, the most important event in my life since marriage—so Clive described it: Bobo shingled me. Mr Cizec has bingled me. I am short haired for life. Having no longer, I think, any claims to beauty, the convenience of this alone makes it desirable. Every morning I go to take up brush & twist that old coil round my finger & fix it with hairpins & then with a start of joy, no I needn't. In front there is no change; behind I'm like the rump of a partridge.
