#### Returning Women to the History of Digital History

- In an example of offering a more inclusive account of digital history, the only mention of digital work done by a woman, was of Kathryn Kish Scalar, who with Thomas Dublin developed Women in Social Movements in the United States, 1775-2000

- The history of digital history paints a picture of a field that is "devoid" of women

- When it comes to understanding why women are hidden in accounts of digital history -- similar to any other form of social injustice -- it is important to question the environment under which such accounts had been written as a way of uncovering the systems and conditions that enabled them

- Women tend to be cited less, in general, and this contributes to the decreased visibility of women in the history of digital history

  - The driving force of this phenomenon is likely also what causes women to achieve senior status in history departments at slower rates than men

  - In history, women are employed in primarily non-tenured positions, and their eagerness to work leads to exploitation

- It is important to look at the contributors to a work of digital history as well as the principal investigators. When we do, women's work on digital history projects can be uncovered

- Teams should strive to document every facet of their work and particularly it's scholarly implications

  - This will help work "get recognized in the organs that perform the authorizing work for the field."

#### HISTORY CAN BE OPEN SOURCE: DEMOCRATIC DREAMS AND THE RISE OF DIGITAL HISTORY

- Part of the reason Wikipedia didn't last is because of its "anarchic editing process and uneven reliability have repelled academics"

  - Wikipedia is probably the most democratic resource on the internet

- Disruption != democratization. A premise that many modern technological pioneers have overlooked, with prime example being Facebook's Mark Zuckerburg.

- University press' maintain their position as the standard of academic publishing

  - In universities, academics are salaried and as a result, their work is measured not based on profit but on an "internal economy driven by readership and impact"

  - However, the majority of scholars don't receive proper compensation for their work

    - "In their pursuit of new projects and new grants, for instance, scholars have long been content to dump information online and call it “democracy.”"

- [American Yawp](americanyawp.com) - A very interesting use of open-publishing by Standford

- Was struck by a particular citation "Bethany Nowviskie—“What Do Girls Dig?”" . Went down a rabbit hole comparing the usage of "girl" as a reference to either a female child or a female young-adult, vs the usage of "boy" as a reference to a male child, and "guy" as both a reference to a male young-adult as well as a gender-neutral reference to a young-adult.

  - Makes you think, where did the word "guy" come from and why had it become so interchangable?

  - Also, why has it become a disfavoured term?

  - [Food for thought](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/08/guys-gender-neutral/568231/). I will say that as a guy, I can't help but understand how the word "guys" reflects a society that is so male-focused. However, I also understand that language is flexible; it is communication. So, from all of what I know -- which isn't that much, I'll say: use it or don't use it, what matters is whom you're talking to.
