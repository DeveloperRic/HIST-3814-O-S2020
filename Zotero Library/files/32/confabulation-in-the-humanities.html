  <p>It’s a tale as old as the “digital humanities” itself: skeptics rightly asking whether or not we are actually learning anything <em>new</em> by using quantitative approaches to historical questions.
This is a legitimate question.
But I find that many scholars actually have a great deal of trouble differentiating what, in retrospect, sounds <em>reasonable</em>, from what we actually <em>already knew</em>.</p>

<p>I’ve run in to an odd version of this in presenting my own research.
In my <a href="https://matthewlincoln.net/dissertation">dissertation</a>,
 I explore how the organization of artistic print producers (including 
designers, plate cutters, and publishers) in the Netherlands shifted 
between 1500 and 1700, and what these changes may have meant for 
individual artists and for their works of art.
I have powered this research, in large part, though computational 
network analysis of a large database of prints from this period.
Without getting bogged down in the details, this essentially involves 
measuring how certain network properties, such as overall 
centralization, or density, or transitivity, change over time.
Let’s take a look at two examples.</p>

<h2 id="example-1">Example 1</h2>

<p>This plot visualizes the changing balance of domestic vs. 
international connections made by Dutch printmakers.
A value of 0 indicates an even balance of connections; positive values 
indicate majority international connections; negative values indicate 
majority domestic connections.</p>

<p><img src="confabulation1.svg" alt="Dutch E-I ratio plot 1"></p>

<p>What are we seeing?
Between 1570–1580, Dutch printmakers shifted very rapidly from making 
the majority of their connections internally, to now making more than 
half of them to international collaborators. 
While the speed of this transition is rather surprising, the shift 
itself is not.
The Dutch had a long history of printmaking through the sixteenth 
century, dating back to the venerable (and venerated) Lucas van Leyden 
at the turn of the 1500s.
In the late sixteenth century, the northern Netherlands began to enter a
 “golden age” of economic growth thanks to their unmatched control of 
international sea trade around the world.
As their prosperity increased, many Dutch authors, musicians, and 
artists sought to add internationalizing elements to their works, as a 
way of asserting Dutch cultural legitimacy in the broader world of early
 Modern Europe.
Waves of Dutch artists also traveled south to Italy, establishing a sort
 of artist’s colony in Rome, while prominent Dutch portraitists found 
patrons in the English court.
Thus, it is not surprising to see that Dutch printmakers also turned 
outward in this period.</p>

<h2 id="example-2">Example 2</h2>
<p>This plot visualizes the changing balance of domestic vs. 
international connections made by Dutch printmakers.
A value of 0 indicates an even balance of connections; positive values 
indicate majority international connections; negative values indicate 
majority domestic connections.</p>

<p><img src="confabulation2.svg" alt="Dutch E-I ratio plot 2"></p>

<p>What are we seeing?
Around 1575, Dutch printmakers shifted very rapidly from making the 
majority of their connections internationally, to now making more than 
half of them to domestic collaborators. 
While the speed of this transition is rather surprising, the shift 
itself is not.
Many prominent sixteenth-century Dutch printmakers like Cornelis Cort 
worked extensively with foreign artists and patrons, and the Antwerp 
print publisher Hieronymus Cock also had a strong influence on northern 
Netherlandish printmakers, especially in Haarlem.
In the late sixteenth century, the northern Netherlands began to enter a
 “golden age” of economic growth thanks to their unmatched control of 
international sea trade around the world.
New wealth supported a flourishing Dutch art market both in Amsterdam as
 well as smaller towns like Utrecht and Delft.
Now rather than having to turn to international partners to produce 
prints (a highly collaborative enterprise), Dutch artists, printmakers, 
and publishers could increasingly work with their own countrymen.
Thus, it is not surprising to see that Dutch printmakers turned inward 
in this period.</p>

<h2 id="huh">Huh?</h2>

<p>One of those plots is the actual result based off of my dataset.
For the other, I have multiplied the E-I ratio by -1 to essentially give opposite results.
Neither results <em>seems</em> particularly surprising, once we’ve constructed a just-so story to rationalize the answers.
You’ll have to go look at my <a href="https://matthewlincoln.net/2014/10/17/foreign-and-domestic-interaction-in-the-early-modern-printmaking-network.html">actual presentation</a>
 on this to see the “real” answer (or, at least, the answer as actually 
derived from my dataset — whether or not this is representative of true 
historical trends is a fair and fascinating question :)</p>

<p>I suppose the point of this post is to articulate my growing concern 
that we are so damn good at coming up with post-facto historical 
explanations to contextualize any given observation, that we are 
particularly susceptible to confabulating these post-facto 
rationalizations with the idea that we somehow <em>knew</em> the results of this quantitative work already (and, implicitly, that we didn’t need to waste our time doing it.)
If I can come up with two perfectly plausible historical scenarios to explain <em>opposing</em>, <em>hypothetical</em> trends, then we clearly don’t have a settled answer to the question already, and it was entirely worth my time to try and <a href="https://matthewlincoln.net/2014/10/17/foreign-and-domestic-interaction-in-the-early-modern-printmaking-network.html">run that humanistic experiment</a> to at least find the actual trend before I began to formulate any conclusions.</p>

<p>In closing, it’s also worth noting that this is distinct from the 
issue of testing if our just-so explanations for network analysis 
observations could <em>feasibly</em> return the patterns observed from 
our data.
On this, I heartily recommend Shawn Graham and Scott Weingart, “The 
Equifinality of Archaeological Networks: An Agent-Based Exploratory Lab 
Approach,” Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory, December 28, 
2014, 1–27, doi:<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10816-014-9230-y">10.1007/s10816-014-9230-y</a>.</p>
