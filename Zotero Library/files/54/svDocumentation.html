<a name="ABOUTORLANDO"></a> <h2>The Orlando Project</h2> <div class="paragraph2">[This introduction describes <em>Orlando</em>'s goals in both literary history and humanities computing. If you just want to get going, start with <a href="http://orlando.cambridge.org/protected/svDocumentation?formname=t&amp;d_id=QUICKTIPSFORNEWUSERS#QUICKTIPSFORNEWUSERS">Getting Started</a> or <a href="http://orlando.cambridge.org/public/svDocumentation?formname=t&amp;d_id=HOWORLANDOWORKS#HOWORLANDOWORKS">How Orlando Works</a>.]</div> <div class="paragraph2"><em>Orlando: Women's Writing in the British Isles from the Beginnings to the Present</em>
 is a new kind of electronic textbase for research and discovery. As a 
new kind of history of women's writing, it seeks to further the study 
and understanding of literature, focusing particularly on the part women
 have played in its development.</div> <div class="paragraph2">This is history with a difference. Together with its literary research, the <a href="http://www.ualberta.ca/ORLANDO/" target="external">Orlando Project</a>
 has been conducting an experiment in humanities computing, looking for 
ways to exploit the possibilities of technology for interpretive and 
critical scholarship. <em>Orlando</em> has been developed to respond to the diverse needs and interests of readers and scholars.</div> <div class="paragraph2"><em>Orlando</em>'s
 differences as literary history arise largely from its integration of 
readable text and electronic structure. That is why we call it a 
textbase rather than a database: it returns results in prose rather than
 in tabular form. Its content and means of delivery are inseparable and 
essential elements of one project. They were built together, making <em>Orlando</em>
 highly responsive to questions its readers ask. Its unique structure 
and searchability allow readers to examine its information and critical 
comment in a wide range of configurations and to re-form this in new and
 creative ways. <em>Orlando</em> is open to the serendipities of 
productive browsing, but it is also designed for searchers with specific
 agendas—that is, for responding to precise, complex questions.</div> 
<a name="ABOUTTHEOAKTREE"></a> <h3>The Oak Tree</h3> <div class="paragraph3">".
 . . a little square book bound in red cloth fell from the breast of her
 leather jacket—her poem The Oak Tree." —Virginia Woolf, <em>Orlando</em><a href="http://orlando.cambridge.org/public/getBibcit?dbref=38273&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=291&amp;t=6:38273" target="external" onclick="javascript:rollyRules('getBibcit?dbref=38273&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=291&amp;t=6:38273','citation'); return false;" onkeypress="javascript:rollyRules('getBibcit?dbref=38273&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=291&amp;t=6:38273','citation'); return false;" title="open bibliographic citation in a new window"><img src="bibcit.gif" alt=" Bibliographic Citation link. " class="BIBCIT"></a></div> <div class="paragraph3">Virginia Woolf's <em>Orlando, a Biography</em>,
 1928, inspires this work in literary history. Woolf's biographical and 
historical fantasy explores the changing conditions of possibility for 
women writing in England from the time of Elizabeth I to her own day, 
and gives us a poet protagonist who is at work throughout the whole of 
this history on the composition of her poem "The Oak Tree". The Orlando 
Project team sees in the oak tree a suggestion of the history of women's
 writing in the British Isles, the growth of history from biography, and
 (in a kind of visual pun) the tree-like structure of our text encoding.</div>  
<a name="WHATISORLANDO"></a> <h3>What is <em>Orlando</em>?</h3> <div class="paragraph3"><em>Orlando: Women's Writing in the British Isles from the Beginnings to the Present</em>
 is a highly dynamic and rich resource for researchers, students, and 
readers with an interest in literature, women's writing, or cultural 
history more generally. With about eight million words of text, it is 
full of factual, critical, and interpreted material. This first release 
of <em>Orlando</em> included biographical and writing career entries on 
over a thousand writers, more than eight hundred and fifty of them 
British women. The number is now (2013) up to nearly 1,300. The list 
also includes selected non-British or international women writers, and 
British and international men, whose writing was an important, sometimes
 a shaping, element in a particular writing climate. <em>Orlando</em> 
also includes more than thirty thousand dated items representing events 
and processes (in the accounts of these writers, but also in the areas 
of history, science, medicine, economics, the law, and other contexts). 
In all of these categories, <em>Orlando</em> continues to grow over time, as it is incrementally enlarged by scheduled updates.</div> <div class="paragraph3"><em>Orlando</em>
 materials are capable of a high degree of interaction. For readers who 
take the time to master its strategies, its capacity to search is 
unprecedented, capable of answering a wide range of readers' queries, 
from the simple request for information about a single writer to more 
complex questions seeking material from across the range of <em>Orlando</em>. <em>Orlando</em>'s
 encoding (the extensive tagging which we describe below), together with
 its custom production (or delivery) system, makes it capable of 
retrieving all sorts of interpretive and qualitative material from its 
extensive textbase—comment of the kind you expect to find in a work of 
humanities scholarship—and of displaying this online.</div> <div class="paragraph3"><em>Orlando</em>
 is not a text archive: it does not print the texts its subjects wrote. 
Instead, it provides new biographical and critical accounts of the lives
 and works of its subjects, together with contextual materials relevant 
to critical and historical readings. <em>Orlando</em> is entirely textual, and its entries were researched and created collaboratively by members of the Orlando team (see <a href="http://orlando.cambridge.org/protected/svDocumentation?formname=t&amp;d_id=CREDITSANDACKNOWLEDGEMENTS#CREDITSANDACKNOWLEDGEMENTS">Credits</a>).
 It fully documents the materials it references, and it includes a 
bibliographical database of more than twenty-five thousand titles.</div>  
<a name="RECOVERINGWOMENWRITERS"></a> <h3>Recovering Women Writers </h3> <div class="paragraph3">When Virginia Woolf wrote about literary history, in her <em>Orlando</em>
 fantasy and elsewhere, she saw women's writing as emerging fully in 
English culture only in the eighteenth century (and, even then, as 
causing outrage and scandal). We know now that women have been writing 
in English for almost as long as there has been writing in English. And 
ever since the century Woolf identified as the beginning, women have 
also been writing about women writing. Clara Reeve's first history of 
the English novel gives generous coverage to women writers; Anna Letitia
 Barbauld's and Elizabeth Inchbald's canon-forming collections of novels
 and plays included women. Julia Kavanagh, Anne Thackeray Ritchie, and 
A. Mary F. Robinson wrote during the Victorian period on earlier women 
writers from both the English and French traditions, and Geraldine 
Jewsbury, as publisher's reader and one of the <em>Athenæum</em>'s 
regular reviewers, hugely influenced women's fiction of the period. The 
pioneering academic scholarship of Myra Reynolds, 'George Paston', and 
Joyce Tompkins about early women writers spans the earlier twentieth 
century. Some of these points are still coming as a surprise to students
 of women's writing, and they require changes to our understandings of 
numerous aspects of writing: the story about the novel, for instance, or
 about nuns, or about early women's reflections on what we would call 
their condition as women, or about early twentieth-century theatre. 
Sometimes they require us to change our story about canonical men: for 
instance, about how much Harriet Taylor contributed not just to John 
Stuart Mill's <em>The Subjection of Women</em> but to his other philosophical writings such as <em>Principles of Political Economy</em>.
 Mostly, they require us to change our story about women, particularly 
the fundamentally diminishing story of which the summary is, "Women 
can't write, women can't paint."<a href="http://orlando.cambridge.org/public/getBibcit?&amp;dbref=38272&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=134&amp;t=6:38272" target="external" onclick="javascript:rollyRules('getBibcit?&amp;dbref=38272&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=134&amp;t=6:38272','citation'); return false;" onkeypress="javascript:rollyRules('getBibcit?&amp;dbref=38272&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=134&amp;t=6:38272','citation'); return false;" title="open bibliographic citation in a new window"><img src="bibcit.gif" alt=" Bibliographic Citation link. " class="BIBCIT"></a> </div> <div class="paragraph3">What
 is as remarkable as the uncovering and publication of new knowledge 
about writing women and their texts is how it came about. Contemporary 
knowledge about the history of women's writing is a consequence of the 
extraordinary development, in the last decades of the twentieth century,
 of academic interest in the recovery of writers who were lost, or 
forgotten, or suppressed, or ignored. It is also a consequence of the 
thorough-going critique of a traditional literary history which could 
not make room for evidence that did not support the grand or canonical 
narrative. This phenomenally vigorous scholarly work of inclusion—of 
writers omitted from traditional historical accounts, at least partly by
 reason of gender or race or class—is arguably the major feature of 
recent literary historical scholarship.</div> <div class="paragraph3">This work of recovery has been a remarkable feat. Massive scholarly effort, acknowledged in <em>Orlando</em>'s
 extensive bibliographical references, has since the late 1960s been 
directed at researching, republishing, re-evaluating and 
recontextualizing female authors, and many studies of women's movements,
 genres, and periods have appeared over recent years. These have made 
available for critical examination whole new territories of women's 
literary production, have cast on them various interpretive lights, and 
have, in turn, allowed this vast new material to throw its light on 
institutional assumptions and practices. All of these projects of 
recovery have dramatically increased knowledge about women's writing, 
and they have opened new possibilities for literary history. Since, in 
the context of a literary modernism preoccupied both by tradition and by
 the reconfiguring power of the 'individual talent', Woolf and others in
 her time opened for renewed debate the issue of women's participation 
in culture, our literary pasts and presents have been radically 
reshaped.</div>  
<a name="THECHALLENGEOFLITERARYHISTORY"></a> <h3>The Challenge of Literary History</h3> <div class="paragraph3">We
 are still without a comprehensive scholarly history of writing by 
British women (and indeed by women writing in other communities of 
identity). Integration of recent scholarship on women's writing has been
 deferred, with the result that while there are countless valuable 
studies of its many particular aspects, there is no large-canvas history
 built on this work. (A fuller discussion of the relationship between 
feminist scholarship and literary history appears in the introduction to
 <em>Women and Literary History: 'For There She Was'</em> and Margaret Ezell, <em>Writing Women's Literary History</em>.)<a href="http://orlando.cambridge.org/public/getBibcit?&amp;dbref=40425&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=&amp;t=6:40425&amp;dbref=40585&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=&amp;t=6:40585" target="external" onclick="javascript:rollyRules('getBibcit?&amp;dbref=40425&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=&amp;t=6:40425&amp;dbref=40585&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=&amp;t=6:40585','citation'); return false;" onkeypress="javascript:rollyRules('getBibcit?&amp;dbref=40425&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=&amp;t=6:40425&amp;dbref=40585&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=&amp;t=6:40585','citation'); return false;" title="open bibliographic citation in a new window"><img src="bibcit.gif" alt=" Bibliographic Citation link. " class="BIBCIT"></a></div> <div class="paragraph3">In
 the context of abundant new scholarship, the absence of an integrated 
history of women's writing is the more striking. Clearly this is not the
 consequence of an inadequate scholarly base. It is instead the outcome 
of powerful challenges to literary history as a genre. The exclusions 
that prompted so vigorous a new movement of scholarly inclusion also 
engendered disabling critiques of existing histories. The genre itself 
has been seen as monolithic, hegemonic, teleological, dependent upon a 
single-voiced narrative that obliterates the multiple and ex-centric 
narratives of writers outside of canonical traditions (including women).
 Narrative itself has come under scrutiny as always ideologically 
invested and deeply implicated in masculine subjectivities and power 
structures. Literary history, traditionally organized in terms of ethnic
 or linguistic groups and nationalist identity categories, has been 
criticized as a dangerous hangover of the nineteenth-century 
nation-state, one that perpetuates "a single, endlessly reiterated fable
 of identity."<a href="http://orlando.cambridge.org/public/getBibcit?&amp;dbref=40586&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=59&amp;t=6:40586" target="external" onclick="javascript:rollyRules('getBibcit?&amp;dbref=40586&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=59&amp;t=6:40586','citation'); return false;" onkeypress="javascript:rollyRules('getBibcit?&amp;dbref=40586&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=59&amp;t=6:40586','citation'); return false;" title="open bibliographic citation in a new window"><img src="bibcit.gif" alt=" Bibliographic Citation link. " class="BIBCIT"></a>
 (The scholarship relevant to debates over literary history is vast. 
Hayden White and Dominick LaCapra have made important interventions from
 a post-structuralist standpoint about history generally. In <em>Is Literary History Possible?</em> David Perkins summarised a debate that continues.)<a href="http://orlando.cambridge.org/public/getBibcit?&amp;dbref=40587&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=&amp;t=6:40587&amp;dbref=40588&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=&amp;t=6:40588&amp;dbref=40589&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=&amp;t=6:40589&amp;dbref=40590&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=&amp;t=6:40590" target="external" onclick="javascript:rollyRules('getBibcit?&amp;dbref=40587&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=&amp;t=6:40587&amp;dbref=40588&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=&amp;t=6:40588&amp;dbref=40589&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=&amp;t=6:40589&amp;dbref=40590&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=&amp;t=6:40590','citation'); return false;" onkeypress="javascript:rollyRules('getBibcit?&amp;dbref=40587&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=&amp;t=6:40587&amp;dbref=40588&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=&amp;t=6:40588&amp;dbref=40589&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=&amp;t=6:40589&amp;dbref=40590&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=&amp;t=6:40590','citation'); return false;" title="open bibliographic citation in a new window"><img src="bibcit.gif" alt=" Bibliographic Citation link. " class="BIBCIT"></a> </div> <div class="paragraph3">Averse
 to large-scale continuous history, late twentieth-century literary 
studies turned away from the national narrative, rather reductively 
characterized by some critics as a strictly evolutionary or 
progressivist one, for histories focused on smaller, marginalized 
groups. According to Linda Hutcheon, "we now get the histories (in the 
plural) of the losers as well as the winners, of the regional (and 
colonial) as well as the centrist, of the unsung many as well as the 
much sung few, and, I might add, of women as well as men." She has 
charged such histories with adopting the traditional teleological 
narrative model as a risky but perhaps strategically justifiable means 
of claiming cultural authority.<a href="http://orlando.cambridge.org/public/getBibcit?&amp;dbref=40594&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=66&amp;t=6:40594&amp;dbref=40591&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=5,%209&amp;t=6:40591" target="external" onclick="javascript:rollyRules('getBibcit?&amp;dbref=40594&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=66&amp;t=6:40594&amp;dbref=40591&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=5, 9&amp;t=6:40591','citation'); return false;" onkeypress="javascript:rollyRules('getBibcit?&amp;dbref=40594&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=66&amp;t=6:40594&amp;dbref=40591&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=5, 9&amp;t=6:40591','citation'); return false;" title="open bibliographic citation in a new window"><img src="bibcit.gif" alt=" Bibliographic Citation link. " class="BIBCIT"></a>
 But Susan Stanford Friedman regards as complementary the 
post-structuralist critique of narrative history and the activist 
imperative towards creating stories that shape the possibilities from 
which futures are forged. <em>Orlando</em> takes up her invitation to 
feminists to engage in "a dialogic, not monologic, project of writing 
feminist histories—in the plural."<a href="http://orlando.cambridge.org/public/getBibcit?&amp;dbref=40592&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=12&amp;t=6:40592" target="external" onclick="javascript:rollyRules('getBibcit?&amp;dbref=40592&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=12&amp;t=6:40592','citation'); return false;" onkeypress="javascript:rollyRules('getBibcit?&amp;dbref=40592&amp;qtdin=&amp;text=12&amp;t=6:40592','citation'); return false;" title="open bibliographic citation in a new window"><img src="bibcit.gif" alt=" Bibliographic Citation link. " class="BIBCIT"></a></div> <div class="paragraph3">Critics
 of literary history will remark on the conjunction of the vast movement
 of scholarly recovery of women's and marginalized writing with the 
powerful theoretical take-down of literary history. We observe simply 
that while the work of recovery made a broader literary history both 
newly possible and newly necessary, the unanswered criticisms of the 
genre contributed to the continued absence of integrating histories of 
women's writing, or of revised general histories that take women's 
writing into account.</div> <div class="paragraph3"><a href="http://orlando.cambridge.org/public/svDocumentation?formname=t&amp;d_id=LITERARYHISTORYWITHADIFFERENCE#LITERARYHISTORYWITHADIFFERENCE">Next Section</a></div>  <a class="backToTop" href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
