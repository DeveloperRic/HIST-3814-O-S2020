About the Project

“Songs of the Ottawa” is an experiment in the digital data sonification of the Ottawa River’s pasts between 1880-1980.
The three “songs" offer a way into the stories of the river’s flows, of commerce and industry extending
up and downstream, and of recreation on the water and shores.

The website

This website is the online home for "Songs of the Ottawa." It gathers images, the songs themselves, and the code used to generate them. The project examines a stretch of river extending from below the Chaudière, Akikodjiwan, or Kana:tso Falls, past the points of confluence with three important waterways – the man-made locks at the Rideau Canal, the tumbling Rideau River falls and the low-lying delta of the Gatineau – to the sandy Kettle and Duck Islands. “Sonifying” the history of the river means to express history to achieve a particular sensual engagement with the past. Sonification is the “visualization” of historical data auditorially, to achieve a particular sensory affect. This project asks readers and listeners to hear uncanny, affective pasts and consider the ways in which storytellers can “de-form” and “re-form” data and sources.

Explore the site and accompanying code, and annotate it with your comments through Hypothes.is, linked on the top right corner of the page.
The essay

As well as the three songs in the sections above, the project also consists of a written essay. This essay includes a more extended discussion of data sonification as a method, as well as chapters describing the historical research undertaken and the technical methods developed in each case.
