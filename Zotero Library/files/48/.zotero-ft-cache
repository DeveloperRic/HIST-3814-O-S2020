To tell the history of the Ottawa River, Cristina Wood translated her research data into the 88 musical notes of a piano keyboard.

Wood calls the approach “sonification,” or expressing information through sound, and Carleton University is giving her a medal for the best research by any master’s student in any department this year.

Now you can hear and read her work online at her project’s website, songsoftheottawa.ca . Do not expect a traditional history essay.

Wood grew up in Rothwell Heights, close to the river, and will graduate Friday with a master’s degree in public history, with a specialization in digital humanities.

It took her some eight months to choose sources and gather the data for this, the major project for her master’s degree. Much of this time she was an intern at the Canada Science and Technology Museum and the Canada Agriculture and Food Museum. The museums gave her some research funding and access to artifacts.

“Sonification is kind of unusual output for historical research,” she said Monday. “We are often accused of relying way too heavily on the visual. Part of my impulse was thinking: OK, what actually happens if you make it sound like something, and does it mean anything to people? That would be the next stage — to evaluate whether it means anything to people.

“I hope it would draw people in to the stories of the river,” she said. While listeners need to be given some context before the sounds make sense, “I hope it draws people in to engaging with a deeper history of the river. I think the river often fades into the background especially in our urban lives, which is why I chose this urban stretch of the river.”

There are three songs (instrumental only).

The first takes historic water level data from 1880 to 1977, and a computer produces musical notes from that, rising and falling with the water levels. Wood says this helps us “tune into the river’s hydrologic cycle.”

The second, designed to illustrate industry along the river’s shores, uses a 3D scan of a sample of pulp produced in the E.B. Eddy mill in 1932. Again the digital data from the scan are transformed into music  by an algorithm. Viewers can also rotate the image of the pulp sample.

The third illustrates boat traffic over the course of one day in the late 1800s, in the section of river between Rockcliffe and Pointe-Gatineau.

“’Sonifying’ the history of the river means to express history to achieve a particular sensual engagement with the past. Sonification is the ‘visualization’ of historical data auditorially, to achieve a particular sensory affect,” she writes on her website. “This project asks readers and listeners to hear uncanny, affective pasts and consider the ways in which storytellers can ‘de-form’ and ‘re-form’ data and sources.”

But what about people who want their history more traditional?

“I’d be hopeful that they could stretch their understanding a little bit,” she said. Traditional history can be too narrow and restrictive, she argues. “What is important to me is that people know something about the places they interact on and (have) an appreciation for their past. And I don’t really mind how that happens.”

She had two supervisors in the history department, Joanna Dean and Shawn Graham. “People only want to read so much. We’re all tired of reading and looking, so what Cristina’s work allows us to do is actually hear the river changing,” Dean said. “Hearing is a different sense and we understand things differently if we hear them. We can hear patterns in music and shifts in music that we might not see if it was in a bar graph.”

Wood is heading to York University for a PhD, and will now explore the history — including oral history — of the full length of the Ottawa River.
