<p><strong> Complicating “Great Man” Narrative of Digital History</strong></p>
<p><em>Edward Ayers. Stephen Brier. Joshua Brown. Daniel Cohen. Roy Rosenzweig. William Thomas.</em></p>
<p>These are the names that spring to mind when many people think of the
 individuals who pioneered the theories and methods of digital history. 
The oft-repeated narratives about the origins of the field are almost 
totally devoid of women. For over a decade now scholars have begun their
 search for the roots of digital humanities with the opening essay in 
Schreibman, et al.’s 2004 collection, <em>A Companion to Digital Humanities</em>.
 Susan Hockey’s “The History of Humanities Computing” offers an origin 
story that is deeply steeped in computational text analysis and text 
processing. It begins with the initial effort of Italian Jesuit Roberto 
Busa and IBM to create a concordance of Thomistic writings, and 
continues through the founding of key scholarly associations, the 
development of the Text Encoding Initiative, and the launch of thematic 
source collections on the Internet. Hockey’s narrative leans toward the 
literary and linguistic, with little attention to how those with 
disciplinary commitments in fields such as history, archeology, or 
anthropology might have found their way to the digital humanities. Those
 stories are saved for subsequent individual essays from the collection 
that deal with the various disciplines.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
<p>As a result curious or aspiring digital historians are likely to turn
 to Will Thomas’s essay “Computing and the Historical Imagination” in 
search of a background on how their fellow historians came to employ 
digital approaches. Thomas’s chapter traces the birth of digital history
 back to the quantitative history movement of the 1960s and 1970s, 
signaled most vividly and controversially by Robert Fogel and Stanley 
Engerman’s <em>Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery</em>
 (1974). Various social history projects brought statistical and 
computational analysis to the fore of historical investigation, and for 
some that route brought them to a more expansive interest in historical 
methods. As computing technologies became more affordable and easier to 
work with, historians embraced the use of databases to track and analyze
 source materials. Access to the world wide web in the early 1990s 
offered another set of possibilities for expanding access to historical 
sources and combining them in new ways for scholarly, educational, and 
public audiences. Thomas suggests that there were vast possibilities for
 new modes of presentation of historical scholarship, and new tools of 
analysis to be applied, with <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight">Historical GIS garnering the most energy and attention at the point of his writing in the early years of the 21</hypothesis-highlight><sup><hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight">st</hypothesis-highlight></sup><hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight"> century. </hypothesis-highlight><hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight">While
 it offers a familiar story that deals with methodological shifts in the
 practice of history, Thomas’s version of the emergence of digital 
history methods neither includes nor cites any digital historians who 
are women. Anne Kelly Knowles, who is a geographer rather than an 
historian, is the sole woman mentioned engaged in digital ventures</hypothesis-highlight>.<sup> <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Published shortly after the <em>Companion</em>, Roy Rosenzweig and Dan Cohen’s <em>Digital History: A Guide to Gathering, Preserving, and Presenting the Past </em>(2005)
 offers a more practical approach to field of digital history. It too 
includes an introduction to the history of field—one that is slightly 
more inclusive that Thomas’s in its treatment of genres and approaches. 
This is a democratic and capacious vision of the history web that does 
not hew to narrowly cast definitions of historical scholarship. Rather, 
it includes examples that are designed for public audiences and that 
which targets the K12 educational fields. Yet, Rosenzweig and Cohen 
managed to point to the digital work of only one woman: Kathryn Kish 
Scalar, who with Thomas Dublin developed <em>Women in Social Movements in the United States, 1775-2000</em>.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>
<p>More recent reviews of the field tend to reproduce these oversights, 
suggesting that the history of digital history is a settled one—one that
 is devoid of women. For example, in her 2014 attempt to puzzle through 
the complexities of the interdisciplinary that characterizes so much 
digital scholarship, Julia Thompson Klein lays out a set of definitions 
of digital humanities and a summary of how digital work has played out 
in core disciplines. While English comes in for extensive discussion, 
Klein offers only three paragraphs each on history and archeology. For 
history, Klein turns in bulk to Thomas’s narrative, with some highlights
 from a 2008 interchange in the <em>Journal of American History</em> and brief article from the American Historical Association’s <em>Perspectives Magazine</em> by Thomas and Douglas Seefeldt. Again, no women feature in Klein’s gloss on the history of digital history.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>
<p>Yet, a brief survey of the contemporary digital history scene quickly
 surfaces a large cohort of women—tenure track and non-tenure track, 
faculty and staff—who are doing exciting work and taking major 
leadership roles. Consider, for instance, the work of Nicole Coleman and
 Paula Findlen at Stanford University’s Center for Spatial and Textual 
Analysis or Miriam Posner and Janice Reiff at the University of 
California Los Angeles’s Center for Digital Humanities.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
 The leadership at George Mason University’s Roy Rosenzweig Center for 
History and New Media (RRCHNM) is two thirds women: Sheila Brennan, 
Jennifer Rosenfeld, Kelly Schrum, and this author&nbsp;.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>
<p>Female historians outside of major digital humanities centers are 
also pursuing field-changing projects. Kalani Craig is using text mining
 to investigate conflict in medieval episcopal biography. Sharon Block 
is using computational analysis to interrogate sources related to early 
American gender history. Jennifer Guiliano has taken a lead in 
professional development training. Erika Lee is leading a broad digital 
collecting project to gather the stories and experiences of Minnesota’s 
recent immigrants. Michelle Moravec is using corpus linguistics to 
investigate the politics of women’s culture and is writing about that 
research in real-time in public. Kathryn Tomasek continues her 
long-standing work on using text encoding with financial records.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
 In the public history universe, major projects can boast leadership 
from Anne Whisnant in North Carolina, Elissa Frankle at the United 
States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Priya Chhaya at the National Trust for
 Historic Preservation, and many, many others.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> These women and their digital history projects are just a sample of the innovative work that is underway all over the world.</p>
<p>Between 2006 and 2015, the American Council of Learned Societies 
(ACLS) offered a Digital Innovation Fellowship for scholars who sought a
 year of support to work on a major digital project. During that period,
 ACLS awarded fellowships to 14 historians, 5 of whom were women.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
 In 2007, both Patricia Seed and Anne Sarah Rubin received fellowships 
for historical geospatial work. In 2010, Abigail Firey received an award
 to work on the Carolingian Canon Law Project. The next year, Ruth 
Mostern’s geospatial work on the Yellow River and imperial engineering 
in North China was funded. And, most recently, Kim Gallon received 
support for her work on the Black press.<sup> <a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></sup>
 This range of work suggests the breath and depth of the ways that women
 are bringing digital theories and methods into their historical work.</p>
<p>These individual historians are not anomalies. In 2013 and 2015 Bryn 
Mawr College’s Albert M. Greenfield Digital Center for the History of 
Women’s Education, under the direction of Monica Mercado, hosted the 
Women’s History in the Digital World Conference, bringing together 
dozens of women doing digital women’s history work.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> The population of female graduate students doing digital history also continues to grow.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>
 Furthermore, female historians are over represented among the cohort of
 mid-career scholars who want to learn new digital methods. Of the 
applicants for RRCHNM’s National Endowment for the Humanities funded 
summer institute, Doing Digital History (2014), 71% of the applications 
for participation came from women, and 65% of the selected participants 
were women.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> In sum, the contemporary cohort of female digital historians is robust, and it looks to remain that way.</p>
<p><em>All of this begs the question, why are there so few women in the history of digital history?</em></p>
<p>Knowing that Thomas, Cohen, Rosenzweig, Seefeldt, and Klein are all 
careful scholars, none of whom has a willful desire to overlook women’s 
efforts, one might reasonably come away with the impression that or 
digital history is a field with no women. Obviously that is not true. In
 fact, women have played essential roles in shaping the digital history,
 and we can find them if we know where to look. But, in addition to 
undertaking the task of recovering women’s contributions to the field, 
we have an obligation to question the conditions that have contributed 
to their erasure, and to consider what systems and conditions become 
visible when we return them to the origin stories for the field. If we 
refuse to interrogate them, then these origin stories will solidify in a
 way that not only distorts the history of digital history, but also in 
ways that shape the field in disadvantageous ways going forward.</p>
<p>Just as the contemporary cohort of female digital historians is 
vibrant, women were integral collaborators in the work from the 
beginning. The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) has been the 
most substantial source of public funding for digital history through 
the years at universities and cultural heritage institutions. While the 
Office of Digital Humanities was established in 2008, digital history 
work has been funded at the NEH through the wide range of programs and 
divisions since the mid-1990s. A comprehensive search of the grants 
database for digital history projects yields 586 individual grants 
funded between 1994 and 2016. A review of those results showed that 
women served as principal investigator (PI) or Co-PI on 300 project, or 
51% of the awards.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
 As the PI or a Co-PI for a particular project these individuals assumed
 the responsibility for meeting the deliverables proposed in the 
application, and fulfilling the terms of the funding set out by the NEH.
 If we look more closely at the NEH funding data, we see that of the 300
 projects for which women served as PI or Co-PI, only 127 or 42% of the 
projects were associated with colleges or universities. Furthermore, the
 projects lead by these women cover the full range of funding 
opportunities offered by the NEH, not just those administered by the 
Office of Digital Humanities. Thus, the distribution of funded projects 
provides some hints at the kinds of work being lead by these principle 
investigators:</p>
<ul>
<li>89 projects (30%) were funded by the Division of Preservation and Access</li>
<li>86 projects (29%) were funded by the Division of Public Programs</li>
<li>39 projects (13%) were funded by the Division of Education Programs</li>
<li>36 projects (12%) were funded by the Office of Digital Humanities</li>
<li>25 projects (8%) were funded by the program for Federal/State Partnerships, which includes grants for state humanities councils</li>
<li>20 projects (6%) were funded by the Division of Research Programs</li>
<li>5 projects (2%) were funded by the Office of Challenge Grants</li>
</ul>
<p>Given that the bulk of the projects were funded by the Divisions of 
Preservation and Access, Public Programs, and Education Programs, we 
might surmise that these ventures were associated with the work of 
libraries and archives, museums and public humanities, and teaching and 
learning.</p>
<p>The relative gender parity among PIs and Co-PIs of NEH funded digital
 history projects suggests that there are factors preventing us from 
recognizing this work. One possible reason we have not recognized the 
significant leadership of women in digital is the generally pervasive 
gender bias in citations. Study after study shows women’s scholarship 
simply gets cited less than men’s in many, many fields.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
 That research cannot be discounted here, but once we recognize that 
women were there as active agents and innovators, guiding and shaping 
the early work of digital history it becomes clear that there are other 
power differentials in play here. Thus, we must look deeper and further 
afield to reclaim the history of women in the digital history—to learn 
who these women are, what kinds of positions they hold, and what kind of
 work they have done. Then, we can begin to understand the structural 
forces in the academy and in cultural heritage institutions that 
facilitate the erasure of women’s influence.</p>
<p>Significant structural factors in labor conditions have combined to 
perpetuate a “great man theory” history of digital history: status, 
access, flexibility, and authorizing and credentialing systems. First, 
structures within the academy have historically slowed women historians’
 advancement, preventing them from surfacing in leadership positions 
with digital projects. Second, a narrow focus on project directors 
causes us to overlook the vast contributions of women in other roles on 
projects. Third, limiting our attention digital work done within the 
halls of academe excludes the work of women who land in non-academic 
positions. Furthermore, the ways that public history organizations 
represent their work can make it difficult to identify women’s labor on 
these projects. Together these conditions make it easy for historians of
 digital history to perpetuate the impression that the pioneering work 
in the field was done by men&nbsp;. Once we go looking for the women who
 innovated in digital history, those who were present to shape the early
 projects, we see a broader picture of historical practice, one akin to 
what Rob Townsend refers to as the “historical enterprise,” one that is 
wider than the halls of academe, filled with many more actors than the 
tenured few.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Beyond the Senior Faculty</strong></p>
<p>Academic labor practices, conditions, and structures have conspired 
to mask or reduce women’s roles in digital history. A number of studies 
prove that women achieve senior status in history departments at much 
slower rates than men. Without the benefits of tenure, women are much 
less free to take on principle investigator or project director roles. 
Also, history departments have been slow to recognize digital work as 
authorized scholarly activity for promotion and tenure review—so much so
 that as late as April 2015 the American Historical Association 
organized a cluster of articles debating the concept of “History as a 
Book Discipline” in <em>Perspectives</em>.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>
 This methodological conservatism could combine with the structural 
sexism at work in the academy to doubly disadvantage women who sought to
 pursue digital work. Finally, large-scale collaborative digital history
 has been deeply dependent on contingent faculty and staff, many of whom
 are women, and many of whom fail to receive meaningful recognition for 
their contributions to these projects.</p>
<p>Concern about the professional status of women in history is 
long-standing. In 1969, the American Historical Association (AHA) formed
 an ad hoc Committee on the Status of Women, which then was 
institutionalized as the Committee on Women Historians in 1971. The ad 
hoc committee produced a report, known as the “Rose report,” in 1970 
&nbsp;that serves as a baseline for understanding the position and 
experiences of women in the field. The findings were not promising. In 
the 1960s, the top ten history graduate programs granted about 15% of 
their degrees to women, but the faculties in the same departments were 
98-99% men. Moreover, while there 16% of the full professors in History 
in coeducational colleges had been women in the 1959-1960 year, by 
1968-1969 on one woman remained at that rank. Summarizing the state of 
the field, the authors explained,</p>
<p>In history as in other academic areas, our sample of thirty 
institutions indicates women are employed primarily in non-tenured 
ranks. Moreover, far from abandoning their professions for pure 
domesticity, their very eagerness to work has made women vulnerable to 
exploitation. Their readiness—and sometimes their need—to accept 
irregular and part-time positions has led to their exclusion from 
participation in the main stream of academic rewards and preferment.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>
<p>The situation has gotten somewhat better in intervening years, but 
slowly. The results from the AHA’s survey in 1979-80 put the percentage 
of women history faculty at 13.3, while women comprised only 5.9% at the
 full professor rank, 11.6% at the associate level, 25.3% at the 
assistant level, and 40.6% at the instructor rank. By 1998 things had 
improved slightly, with women making up 17.1% of the history faculty, 
and 8.2% at full, 14.2% at associate, 38.9% at assistant ranks, and 
37.3% as instructors. With the 1998 survey, women had risen to 55% of 
history faculty at the assistant level, but only 18% of faculty at the 
full professor level.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2006, the Committee on Women Historians published <em>The Status of Women in the Historical Profession, 2005</em>,
 based on a survey sent to all the women members of the AHA, which 
yielded 362 responses. The report provides a fascinating qualitative 
snap-shot of the sexism and discrimination in the field. Time to 
promotion and salaries continue to lag behind. Women bear an inordinate 
brunt of the burden of service. Assumptions about gender powerfully 
shape subjective, if standardized, evaluations of research, teaching, 
and service. Women shoulder a disproportionate responsibility for child 
and eldercare, which can disrupt early and mid-career advancement. The 
survey results prompted the CWH to issue a statement on best practices 
in supporting gender equity in the workplace.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>
<p>These findings echo the classic of sociologist Arlie Hochschild, whose 1989 book <em>The Second Shift</em>,
 articulated the way that women are hindered by bearing the brunt of 
domestic responsibilities while also working to maintain a productive 
professional life.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>
 This bind can be especially difficult for women in academe who may face
 the impact of child bearing and rearing at exactly the time when their 
careers require the most concentrated scholarly progress in the years 
leading up to tenure review. Not all women find themselves in this 
position, but enough do to contribute to the slowing of forward motion 
on the promotion track for women in the sector overall.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the structures of academic advancement in history have 
been slow to recognize digital scholarship for promotion and tenure, 
disadvantaging all scholars working in the field, but especially women 
whose promotion can be slowed by other factors. While the Modern 
Language Association has had guidelines on evaluating digital 
scholarship since 2000, the historical profession had no such guidance 
until recently.<sup> <a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></sup> 
As a result those hoping to build and support tenure cases for digital 
historians had to rely upon the example of the MLA and adapt the 2010 
report of the Organization of American Historians-National Council on 
Public History-American Historical Association’s Working Group on 
Evaluation of Public History Scholarship, “Tenure, Promotion, and the 
Publicly Engaged Academic Historian.”<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23"><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>
<p>The AHA recently has adopted a set of guidelines, raising the hopes 
of those who want to put digital methods at the center of their careers.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24"></a></p>
<p>Even with these pressures, women were prime movers in some of the 
earliest digital history projects. For instance, in September 2000, <em>Common-Place: The Interactive Journal of Early American Life</em> published its first issue.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25"><sup>[25]</sup></a>
 As its founding editors, Jane Kamensky and Jill Lepore embraced the 
possibilities of the web for creating community and conversation around 
history early in their careers. Kamensky was a junior professor at 
Brandeis, not yet the Director of the Schlesinger Library on the History
 of Women at Harvard University’s Radcliffe Institute for Advanced 
Study. Similarly, Lepore had yet to take up her role as a staff writer 
for <em>The New Yorker</em>, or assume her current position as Harvard College Professor.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> <em>Common-Place</em>
 represented one of the first attempts to create a fully digital 
publication for the historical community. Each issue included feature 
columns, reviews, a teaching section, a focus on material culture and an
 author interview. Now sponsored by the American Antiquarian Society and
 the University of Connecticut, the journal continues to publish 
quarterly.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27"><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>
<p>Since 2001, the <em>Journal of American History</em> has published 
reviews of over 300 digital projects, covering a wide range of types, 
including digital collections, exhibits, teaching and learn projects, 
and many other hybrid projects.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> And, the first website to be reviewed by the <em>Journal of American History</em> in 2001 was an outgrowth of women’s history produced by women, and it was reviewed by a woman, Jane Kamensky. <em>DoHistory</em> was the companion site to Laurel Thatcher Ulrich’s prize winning 1990 book, <em>A Midwife’s Tail</em>,
 and Writer-Producer Laurie Kahn-Leavitt and Director Richard Rogers’s 
film, which dramatized both the historian’s process and the life of the 
eighteenth century midwife who’s diary was at the heart of the story. 
Created by the Film Studies Center at Harvard University, the site 
allows visitors to explore Martha Ballard’s diary and the historical 
investigations that went into piecing together Ballard’s story, and the 
book and film that followed&nbsp;.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29"><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>
<p>By 2012 women made up 37.7% of the history faculty at four-year 
institutions, but that growth in numbers does not necessarily indicate 
an easing of the conditions that slow women’s advancement.<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30"><sup>[30]</sup></a>
 And, advancement matters deeply to the ways that the story of digital 
history gets told. This slow penetration of the upper ranks of the 
profession contributes to the erasure of women from the representation 
of leadership in digital history. One key reason is the ways that 
federal grant requirements are structured. For the most part, securing 
federal funding requires an applicant to provide a significant amount of
 cost-shared resources from their university, often representing an 
amount equal to the requested funding. For women who are slower to 
advance to tenure and through the ranks of promotion, the resulting 
differential in salary can make generating that cost-share required to 
lead these projects very difficult&nbsp;. (Cost-share requirements are 
designed by funders to demonstrate the institutional investment in a 
project by eliciting a pledge of institutional resources. Thus, the 
higher a person’s salary the lower a percentage of commitment is 
required to meeting the dollar amount threshold set by the funding 
agency.) Similarly, struggling under the additional responsibilities of 
service that are foisted upon women and people of color can make it 
remarkably difficult to make time for outside research projects that 
involve a level of service and management of their own that far exceeds 
that required to produced a single-authored monograph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Beyond the Principal Investigator</strong></p>
<p>Frequently the attribution of credit for digital work stops at the 
top of the masthead, so to speak, with the principal investigator or the
 project director. &nbsp;Even if this practice is simply as result of 
convenience—a shorthand, it contributes to the historical erasure of 
women from the field. While the funding agencies do not generally set 
terribly restrictive policies, each applicant organization sets the 
terms by which an individual can serve as a principal investigator. In 
many colleges and universities, individuals who hold staff positions are
 not eligible to hold the role. In other institutions, one must have a 
doctoral degree to serve as a PI. Those who have a doctoral degree but 
who are funded by sponsored research projects cannot offer any salary 
cost-share to the budgeting process, so are frequently not named as 
principal investigators on projects, despite playing primary roles in 
the work. Given these restrictions, a true review of the history of 
digital history requires that we investigate the full breath of the 
collaborative groups that have produced digital history in the past. 
Looking past the project directors to the project managers, the 
researchers, and the staff reveals that women were major contributors to
 this work at all stages along the way.</p>
<p>The University of Virginia’s <em>The Valley of the Shadow</em> 
project, begun in 1991 and launched on the web in 1993, stands as the 
quite possibly the most visible digital history project in the field, 
winning the AHA’s James Harvey Robinson Award for outstanding teaching 
aid in 2002 and the MERLOT (California State University’s Multimedia 
Educational Resources for Learning and Online Teaching) History Classics
 award in 2005, among others.<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31"><sup>[31]</sup></a>
 While the project is often framed as the work of Edward Ayers and 
William G. Thomas, the list of integral co-editors also included Anne 
Sarah Rubin and Andrew Torget, both of whom have gone on to have 
significant careers in digital history. Rubin was a graduate student 
when she served as project manager for the project between 1993 and 
1996, and she took off the 1995-1996 school year to work full time on 
the Valley. In 2000, she was coauthor with Edward Ayers of&nbsp;<em>The Valley of the Shadow: Two Communities in The American Civil War. Part I: The Eve of War</em>.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> Rubin went on to earn an ACLS Digital Innovation Fellowship that contributed to the production of <em>Sherman’s March and America: Mapping Memory</em> the geospatial site that accompanied her 2014 book <em>Through the Heart of Dixie: Sherman’s March and American Memory</em>.<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33"><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>
<p>By the late 1990s, a collaborative team from the American Social 
History Project—Center for Media and Learning at The Graduate 
Center/City University of New York and the Center for History and New 
Media at George Mason University embarked on <em>History Matters: the U.S. Survey Course on the Web</em>.
 The leadership team for the project was evenly split between men and 
women, with Pennee Bender, Stephen Brier, Joshua Brown, Ellen Noonan, 
Roy Rosenzweig, and Kelly Schrum guiding the work that produced over 
1,000 edited and annotated primary sources, hundreds of website reviews,
 and a cluster of multimedia guides to analyzing various types of 
historical evidence.<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> In 2005, <em>History Matters</em>
 won the American Historical Association’s James Harvey Robinson Prize 
for its contribution to the teaching and learning of history. In the 
years after <em>History Matters</em>, Bender, Noonan, and Schrum have 
produced dozens of digital history projects, many centered on 
pedagogy&nbsp;, from their respective roles at ASHP/CML and RRCHNM.<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35"><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>
<p>This initial work on the <em>Valley of the Shadow</em> and on <em>History Matters</em>
 took place in conjunction with the creation of some of the key 
institutions that supported the growth of digital history. Founded in 
1981 by noted labor historian Herbert Gutman and Steven Brier, the 
American Social History Project (ASHP) was the first of the 
organizations to embrace digital means to develop and distribute their 
work. In 1990, ASPH became a research center at the City University of 
New York, known as the Center for Media Learning (CML). Joshua Brown 
took over as the Executive Director in 1998. ASHP/CML has always had a 
staff with many women in leadership positions, with current Associate 
Director Andrea Adas Vásquez joining in 1989, current Associate Director
 Pennee Bender joining in 1992, and Ellen Noonan joining in 1998. Each 
of these women has been integral to the development and success of a 
host of digital history projects over the last twenty-five years.<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36"><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>
<p>A close collaborator with the ASHP/CML team, Roy Rosenzweig founded 
the Center for History and New Media within the History and Art History 
Department at George Mason University in 1994. RRCHNM also has always 
had women in key positions. Elena Razlogova joined Rosenzweig 
immediately, and served as programmer, system administrator, historian, 
and postdoctoral fellow until she departed to take up a position in the 
History Department at Concordia University in 2005. Kelly Schrum came to
 RRCHNM as a post-doctoral fellow in 2001 and has served as the Director
 of Educational Projects since 2005. Stephanie Hurter joined the group 
as a research assistant in 2002 and worked as a web designer until she 
departed for the U.S. State Department in 2006, and completed her 
doctorate in 2010. Amanda Shuman worked as a web developer from 2003 
until she went to pursue a doctoral degree in Chinese History at the 
University of California, Santa Cruz in 2006. Joan Fragaszy Troyano 
joined the Center as a research assistant in 2003, worked on history of 
science projects until her departure in 2005 to pursue a doctoral degree
 in American Studies at George Washington University, and returned to 
the Center between 2011 and 2014 to oversee the PressForward project. 
This author joined the group in 2004 as Associate Director of 
Educational Projects, and has served as Director of Public Projects 
since 2007. Sheila Brennan joined the Center as a research assistant in 
2005 working on a wide range of public history projects, completed her 
doctorate in American history in 2010, and currently serves as the 
Director of Strategic Initiatives. Finally, Jennifer Rosenfeld joined 
the group in 2010 and is the Associate Director of Educational Projects.
 This cohort of women only begins to scrape the surface of the people 
who have actively shaped the well over 70 projects undertaken by RRCHNM 
since 1994.<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37"><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>
<p>Finally, much of the labor on the <em>Valley</em> project took place 
in the context of the Virginia Center for Digital History (VCDH), which 
Ayers and Thomas founded in 1998. VCDH produced many projects, and 
included a number of women in key leadership roles. For example, Kim 
Tryka served as Assistant Director, and made major technical, 
structural, and information architecture contributions to a host of 
projects. Tryka went on to be a data research librarian at the National 
Library of Medicine. Alice Carter also served as Associate Director, 
supporting teaching and learning programs. The staff alumni list 
includes women in project management, programming, and designing roles. 
Finally, the VCDH list of seventeen individual project directors only 
includes one women, the list of student alumni includes many,many women.<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38"><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>
<p>All of these early projects and foundational centers suggest that 
women’s work on digital history projects can get buried if we only pay 
attention to the founders and the individuals who are listed as 
principal investigators. In 2011, Tanya Clement and Doug Reside gathered
 a group of digital humanists at the Maryland Institute for Technology 
in the Humanities to discuss issues surrounding professionalization in 
digital humanities centers.<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39"><sup>[39]</sup></a>
 The conversations at that meeting recognized the significant degree to 
which digital humanities labor is performed by contingent faculty and 
classified staff, often who fail to receive sufficient credit for their 
efforts on projects. The two day gathering resulted in a full report 
with clear recommendations and the creation of the “Collaborator’s Bill 
of Rights.”&nbsp; The recommendations call for academic institutions to 
allow for scholarly staff to serve as principal investigators on grant 
funded work and strongly emphasize the need for each digital project to 
have a full and explicit credits page that accounts for everyone who has
 worked on the project.<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40"><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>
<p>Making concerted progress on these to factors is essential in 
surfacing women’s work in digital humanities and in digital history 
specifically, but it is not enough. As historians, digital and 
otherwise, watching the changing contours of our field, once these 
acknowledgements are made we need to make an effort to actually read the
 credit and about pages that accompany digital history projects, and to 
grapple with the range and significances of the contributions of the 
entire project team. Doing so will quickly surface the important work of
 the large numbers of women in digital history.</p>
<p>Furthermore, digital history project teams need to write explicitly 
about their work, both about the process and its scholarly implications.
 Over the course of his career, Roy Rosenzweig wrote enough articles and
 essays to fill an edited collection on digital history. In 2003, Edward
 Ayers and Will Thomas published one of the <em>American Historical Review</em>’s only hybrid digital articles based in the corpus of materials provided through the <em>Valley of the Shadow</em>
 project. Dan Cohen published numerous articles on his experiments in 
computational methods in historical research. Stephen Brier and Joshua 
Brown wrote about the preservation challenges surrounding the <em>September 11 Digital Archive</em>
 for the tenth anniversary of those tragic events. Cumulatively, these 
publications represent mark a lasting place in the authorized scholarly 
record.<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> For 
contingent faculty and staff being paid out of grant funding that 
requires the assignment of all of their labor to particular projects 
with no latitude for their own exploratory work, producing these kinds 
of peer reviewed articles can be nearly impossible to do given the 
timescales and constraints of project deliverables. Unless the 
analytical writing is built into the grant or the project plan, it is 
extraordinarily difficult to fit in, and the review and revision cycles 
for traditional scholarly publishing can outlast the period of 
performance for the project&nbsp;. Nonetheless, we must take this step 
so that the work gets recognized in the organs that perform the 
authorizing work for the field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Beyond the Academy</strong></p>
<p>Another way to get a better sense of the significant work of women in
 digital history to is to widen the scope of the work held up as 
representative of the field to include the larger “historical 
enterprise.”<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> 
Digital history continues to be represented in digital humanities in 
very narrow ways, often overlooking work that takes place outside of the
 academy within the bounds of public history institutions such as 
libraries, archives, and museums. Even when historians of digital 
history recognize significant projects from libraries, archives, and 
museums, they fail to acknowledge the ways that collaborative efforts 
are represented as institutional products in those venues. This practice
 masks the individual contributions and achievements of all who labor to
 produce it, including women.</p>
<p>This situation is born out in the way that the more than 300 digital history projects reviewed in the pages of the <em>Journal of American History</em>
 cite the work under examination. Of the reviewed projects, 68 (22%) 
explicitly list individual producers. A review of the names and some 
research suggests that of those with individual producers, 28 projects 
(9%) listed women (often in conjunction with men) and the other 40 
projects (13%) listed only men. The remaining 239 projects point to some
 sort of institutional or organizational body as the producer: libraries
 and archives (31%), public history organizations (26%), universities 
(15%), and commercial entities (6%).<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43"><sup>[43]</sup></a>
 The general practice of these cultural heritage organizations is to 
recognize the organization as the creator/producer rather than the 
individual, which means that we need to do a little bit of digging to 
surface the ways that women have contributed to these projects.</p>
<p>We need a more broad definition of digital history work to surface 
the involvement of women employed at non-academic organizations. <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight">An examination of the workforce in cultural heritage organizations suggests that women will continue to lead the way.</hypothesis-highlight>
 Though no data exists specifically for history museums, the American 
Association of Museums reports that as of 2009, the field as a whole was
 almost evenly split between men and women, with women representing 
47.5% of a workforce that totaled just over 400,000 employees.<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44"><sup>[44]</sup></a>
 The 2006 census data about the archival profession reported that the 
65% of the respondents were women. This gender balance represented a 
complete reversal of the ratio in the profession in 1956. Furthermore, 
there were almost twice as many women as men employed in academic 
archives. Finally, the trend in the field suggested an even more 
dramatic swing toward being dominated by women: nearly 4 out of 5 
respondents under the age of 30 were women.<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45"><sup>[45]</sup></a>
 These individuals perform appraisal, selection, and description work 
that provides access to the body of evidence that historians rely upon 
to do their research. All of this is interpretive work in that shapes 
the contours of our understanding of the past. Finally, the available 
data on public historians also suggests that the field is heavily 
female. While women represent roughly 40% of the historians in academic 
settings, a 2008 survey of public historians reports that women comprise
 nearly 65% of the staff in that field. Like the situation with the 
archivists, this number represented a complete reversal of the status in
 1980 when women accounted for only 36% of the field.<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46"><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>
<p>For example, libraries and archives pioneered digital work to provide
 access to historical materials. One of the earliest and most 
recognizable digital history projects was the Library of Congress’s 
American Memory project.<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47"><sup>[47]</sup></a>
 Growing out of the National Digital Library Program (NDLP), American 
Memory eventually brought over 9 million digitized sources related to 
U.S. history and culture to the public.<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48"><sup>[48]</sup></a>
 Martha Anderson was integral to that work. She joined the Library staff
 in 1996 to work on the NDLP, and served as the production coordinator 
for American Memory. This pioneering project changed the field by 
dramatically increasing access to cultural heritage resources. Anderson 
went on to take a leadership role at the National Digital Information 
Infrastructure Preservation Program, shepherding over a decade of work 
on digital preservation and stewardship until her retirement in 2012.<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49"><sup>[49]</sup></a>
 Anderson was joined in this effort by many women who have become 
leaders in the field of preservation and access, such as Abby Smith 
Rumsey and Abbie Grotke.<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50"><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>
<p>Documentary editing projects—often housed at universities but staffed
 by non-tenure-line scholars—also embraced digital means of production 
and distribution quickly. One of the first ventures in historical 
documentary editing to do so was the <em>Model Editions Partnership</em>,
 which was funded by the National Historical Publication and Records 
Commission at the National Archives in 1995. The partnership brought 
together seven major documentary projects to experiment with creating 
digital editions using a subset of the Text Encoding Initiative markup.<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> The key initial partners included the <em>Documentary History of the First Federal Congress</em>, edited by Charlene Bickford, the <em>Papers of Margaret Sanger</em>, edited by Esther Katz and Cathy Moran Hajo, and the <em>Papers of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony</em>, edited by Ann Gordon. Eventually, the<em> Papers of Eleanor Roosevelt</em>,
 edited by Allida Black, joined the partnership. Together, these editors
 formed a significant portion of the leading edge of documentary editing
 practice, and transformed the workflows that govern the production of 
scholarly editions today. At the University of Virginia similar efforts 
were afoot with the <em>Dolly Madison Digital Edition</em>, edited by Holly C. Shulman, which published its first installment online in 2004.<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52"><sup>[52]</sup></a>
 Shulman, who served as the Director of Documentary Editions at VCDH, 
went on in 2007 to join forces with Susan Holbrook Perdue to found 
Documents Compass, a non-profit organization that is part of the 
Virginia Foundation for the Humanities, to assist and advise documentary
 editors on the creation of digital editions.<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53"><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>
<p>Experimentation with digital forms also infiltrated public history 
work, as museums and historical societies developed complex interpretive
 projects. One of the first of these began before there was a graphic 
web to be browsed, when in the late 1980s a coalition of members of the 
Society for the History of Technology applied to the National Science 
Foundation for a curriculum development&nbsp; grant to bring the history
 of science and technology into the social studies classroom, attracting
 women and minority students to the topics. Shepherded by Susan Smulyan,
 Bruce Sinclair, a large collaborative group of scholars, teachers, and 
public historians produced eight units that focused on textile 
technology in American History, drawing on the collections at the 
Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation at the 
Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American History, and the 
expertise at the Center for Children and Technology. Three of the eight 
modular curriculum units in the <em>Whole Cloth</em> project were published on the web in 1998.<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54"><sup>[54]</sup></a>
 Subsequently, Smulyan, from her position at Brown University, has 
spearheaded a number of collaborative cross-cultural and 
student-centered digital history projects. Since 2014, she has directed 
the John Nicholas Brown Center for Public Humanities and Cultural 
Heritage.<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55"><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>
<p>While some were at work creating curriculum that brought together 
collections and new approaches to digital history, others were 
attempting to translate physical museum exhibits into the web 
environment. In October 2001, the National Museum of American History 
launched the <em>A More Perfect Union: Japanese Americans and the U.S. Constitution</em> website.<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56"><sup>[56]</sup></a>
 Jennifer Locke Jones, who is now Chair and Curator of the Division of 
Armed Forces History at NMAH, began her career at the museum working on 
the <em>A More Perfect Union</em> museum exhibit, which debuted in 1987.
 Then, she went on to be the Online Exhibit Curator for the website, 
undertaking the task of creating a digital project that represented the 
complex issues and themes highlighted in the museum exhibit. Jones was 
joined in this venture by Judith Gradwohl, who was the Web Program 
Director at the time, and a large team of collaborators at NMAH and at 
Second Story Interactive Studio.<sup> <a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57">[57]</a></sup>
 The site won widespread praise, including taking the gold award in the 
history and culture category of the 2002 American Alliance of Museums’ 
Media and Technology Professional Network’s “Muse Awards” for work that 
best uses digital media to enhance the GLAM experience.<a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58"><sup>[58]</sup></a></p>
<p>Innovative digital public history work was not solely concentrated at
 the Smithsonian Institution. One of the most advanced projects in 
digital public history at the time was the <em>Raid on Deerfield: Many Stories of 1704</em>
 from the Memorial Museum and the Potumtuck Valley Memorial Association.
 The site brought together collaborators from Native American and French
 Canadian cultural organizations to provide the multiple perspectives 
that five cultural groups (English, French, Wendat [Huron], Kanienkehaka
 [Mohawk], and Wobanaki) had on the conflict that took place in 
Deerfield Massachusetts.<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59"><sup>[59]</sup></a>
 Lead by Timothy Neumann, Lynne Spichiger, Angela Goebel-Bain, Barbara 
Mathews, Juliet Jacobson, and Don Button the site brought together 
primary sources, personal narratives, composite characters, artifacts 
and timelines to illustrate the conflicting understandings of this 
deeply important historical moment that touched the lives of Native 
peoples, French Canadians, and English colonial settlers.<a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60"><sup>[60]</sup></a>

<p>These few examples highlight both early exemplary projects, and the 
key women who lead that work. Unfortunately, for the majority of digital
 history projects from cultural heritage institutions—institutions that 
employ remarkable numbers of women, it will be very difficult to clearly
 identify the individuals who participated in their planning and 
development since the majority of that work is identified as the work of
 the institution—the library, archive, museum, or historical society. 
Thus, dozens of other women who have produced extreme significant 
digital history work will remain nameless. Perhaps in the future, 
regardless of whether or not their positions demand that their work be 
“work for hire,” the librarians, archivists, curators, editors, and 
public historians who collaborate on these projects will adhere to the 
recommendations put forth in the “Collaborators’ Bill of Rights” and 
create full and explicit credits and acknowledgements for the work so 
that all of the contributions can be clearly known.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Even the most cursory survey of the contemporary digital history 
landscape reveals that the field is populated with many, many women who 
are doing important work—directing projects, following new lines of 
inquiry, experimenting with innovative theories and methods, and pushing
 the field forward. If the fact that the quality of this work is on par 
with that of men’s is evident, we must ask ourselves why the stories we 
tell about the birth of the field include no women. If there is a 
groundswell of women doing exciting digital history work now, where did 
they come from? Where they there from the beginning? The recovery of the
 work of women on the first decade of the digital history web argues 
strongly that they were present and productive in this field from its 
earliest days. Ayers, Brier, Brown, Cohen, Rosenzweig, and Thomas 
undeniably shaped the field that we have inherited, but they were joined
 by a cast of women historians who also labored to mold digital history 
into the field we recognize today.</p>
<p>As with all systems that have been historically beset by unequal 
access to resources, opportunities, and power, the academy maintains 
structures that we need to deconstruct so that we can move forward. We 
must work purposefully to recognize the contributions of the 
underrepresented—those whose work is masked by inequity. Then, we must 
consciously revise our origin stories to be inclusive of these 
individuals and their influence. This essay tries to take small steps 
toward accomplishing this recovery and revision.</p>
<p>Yet, we must also grapple with the systematic and structural factors 
that have resulted in the erasure. Returning women to the story is not 
enough. We have to continue to work to revise the academic systems that 
have slowed women’s advancement to the senior ranks of the discipline of
 history. We have to work for full and fair representation of all of the
 contributions to collaborative digital projects—from those of the 
principal investigator, to those of the contingent faculty and 
post-docs, to those of the project managers, to those of the staff, to 
those of the graduate and undergraduate research assistants.<hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight">
 Finally, we have to be willing to look further afield than traditional 
scholarly homes to recognize the major work that is occurring in the 
cultural heritage organizations where so many women are employed doing 
digital history work. Once we begin to do this work we will find 
ourselves much closer to being able to craft a more accurate and 
representative history of digital history.</hypothesis-highlight></p>

				<p>Very informative and thought-provoking article.  In addition to 
the other steps mentioned in the article to increase awareness of the 
involvement of women in digital history, more recognition by promotion 
and tenure committees and policies that DH scholarship is collaborative 
and not the result of one person alone is needed.  Individuals need to 
describe their roles and the roles of others in producing scholarly 
materials, and citation patterns need to reflect the changing reality in
 the field of historical research.  While print monographs may be 
produced by individuals, much digital history will be collaborative.</p>
