DIGH 3814 notes

An account of my work for DIGH/HIST 3814 Section O Summer 2020. I tried to keep my work here as organised as possible but some links are broken because I write everything locally, on my computer.
Published websites
Analysing Virginia Woolf‚Äôs Diaries

This is a website that shows my thought process and actions throughout my investigation of Virginia Woolf's diary. I included all the sources/tools I used in the process so you can re-create my findings as well.
DIGH 3814 static website (personal)

The static website is basically this page but with all the weekly work journals expanded. You can go there if you want a quick read about everything I did.
