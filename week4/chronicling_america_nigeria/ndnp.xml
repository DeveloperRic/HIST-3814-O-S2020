<p>I hope that you and your families remain well this month. On Monday, we will observe Memorial Day, honoring the service and sacrifices of members of our armed forces. Our nation is strong and it endures because of the men and women who give it their all in protecting and preserving our democracy.</p>
<p>Since 2000, the Veterans History Project (VHP) at the Library has been committed to collecting, preserving and making accessible the personal accounts of American war veterans. And while many of the stories collected are from living veterans, there are thousands that were donated posthumously by family members looking to preserve the legacies of their loved ones. &ldquo;Say Their Name. Learn Their Story&rdquo; is a wonderful blog post highlighting the stories of individuals who have given their lives in service of our country, and who are memorialized in the VHP collections.

<p>The Library of Congress buildings remain closed to the public, with all public events currently canceled until further notice. Visit our web site for full, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/about/pandemic-information/for-public/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up-to-date information about our response to COVID-19</a>.

<p><strong>#</strong><strong>FolklifeArchiveChallenge<br /></strong></p>
<p>Although some cities and states are starting to open up a little, we have a feeling it will be a while before we&rsquo;re going out to concerts, theaters, jams, or open mics to perform or enjoy live music and performing arts. At the Library of Congress, we have an amazing online archive of folk music and folklife which you can explore right from home, and we&rsquo;d like to offer a suggestion: why not learn a song, tune, poem, or story from the archive, make a recording or video of yourself performing it, and post it online? Or make a work of art based on one of our photos, or write a story or poem based on our materials. We&rsquo;d love to see what you come up with! Folks from all genres and creators of all art forms are invited to interpret a field recording, video, photo, or manuscript from the AFC Archive. You don&rsquo;t need to be a professional in order to participate!</p>

Hayden, Librarian of Congress" title="" width="210" height="210" style="float: left;" /><em>In 1800, as part of an act of Congress providing for the removal of the new national government from Philadelphia to Washington, President John Adams approved an act of Congress providing $5,000 for books for the use of Congress&mdash;the beginning of the Library of Congress.</em></p>
<p>Since that beginning 220 years ago, the Library has grown to become the largest library in the world with a collection of more than 170 million items that document human creativity and achievement across the centuries and around the globe.</p>
<p>Collecting and providing access to these collections takes on a new meaning and significance in our current world. With social distancing as the norm, and more time spent at home, we want to continue to highlight ways to connect with our content, our knowledgeable staff, and each other during these times. From April 24 to 30, you can celebrate the Library&rsquo;s 220th birthday by participating in online programs from across the Library, reading themed posts on our blogs and social media channels, and <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-20-032/?loclr=ealn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downloading our brand new app</a> to explore the Library&rsquo;s digital collections from home.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Almost 150 years ago on October 8, 1871, the Great Fire of Chicago began in a small dwelling on "the west side"&nbsp; of the city. Two days later, as the conflagration finally died down, the Chicago Tribune printed a brief two-page issue, its first since the disaster began. Its own home offices devastated by the fire, after detailed descriptions of the destruction, the paper declared "CHICAGO SHALL RISE AGAIN."

Farmers across the country petitioned to end national daylight saving time in 1919 but President Wilson vetoed the repeal stating it &ldquo;would be of very grave inconvenience to the country.&rdquo; He would go on to reject the bill a second time on August 15, 1919. <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030193/1919-07-12/ed-1/seq-1/?loclr=eacam" target="_blank" title="Read more about it" rel="noopener">Read more about it</a> and follow us on Twitter @librarycongress #ChronAm!</p>
