# DIGH 3814 Week 3 Journal

## Contents

I've decided to include content links starting this week because of how long my notes/journals get. _(It definitely looks long in my editor.)_

1. [new stuff](#new-stuff)
2. [hiccups](#hiccups)
3. [readings](#readings)

## New Stuff

### Corpus

I noticed this word in the instructions for R and realised that I had seen it before but I didn't really know what it meant. For my own reference, corpus is a language resource consisting of a large and structured set of texts.

### Voyant

This definitely is a gateway drug. I don't fully understand it yet but so far, in my interactions with it, it seems like a very powerful and useful tool.

Building my own corpus and visualising it was quite the fun experience. Defintiely, using regex to parse the newspapers was no fun! But I was really happy with my results.

## Hiccups

### Voyant input error

_a short form of this is also [in my notes](notes.md#voyant-input-error)_

Voyant failed to load the content from the url that was provided to us ([https://craftingdh.netlify.app/data/cnd.xlsx](https://craftingdh.netlify.app/data/cnd.xlsx)).

I searched up the problem in Discord and someone else had the same problem as me. I tried the solution that worked for them -- using [https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=1b1176715ac6efbcc762f127d7ff37d2](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=1b1176715ac6efbcc762f127d7ff37d2) instead of the provided url. That link didn't work either, so I tried another solution (uploading the Excel sheet, not depending on Voyant to download the file), and that worked! Thank God for community forums! Definitely a good idea Dr. Graham, especially since I like working through things myself, unlike a classroom or email, we can all just collaborate without the stress. I'll definitely be posting more!
