# DIGH 3814 notes

An account of my work for DIGH/HIST 3814 Section O Summer 2020. I tried to keep my work here as organised as possible but some links are broken because I write everything locally, on my computer.

## Published websites

### [Analysing Virginia Woolfâ€™s Diaries](https://developerric.github.io/HIST-3814-O-S2020.github.io)

This is a website that shows my thought process and actions throughout my investigation of Virginia Woolf's diary. I included all the sources/tools I used in the process so you can re-create my findings as well.

### [DIGH 3814 static website (personal)](https://developerric.github.io/)
